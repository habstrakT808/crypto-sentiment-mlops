1nly2tw,Trump's crypto corruption is destroying regulatory credibility,"Look, I've been in crypto long enough to remember when we actually cared about decentralization and fair markets. what's happening with Trump's crypto empire isn't just unethical - it's actively damaging the industry we've all invested in.

The numbers are staggering and impossible to ignore.

the scale of personal enrichment is unprecedented:

trump and his sons made $5 billion on paper in a single day when their WLFI token started trading. Let that sink in - five billion dollars in one day while sitting in the White House.

Forbes reports trump has made $1.2 billion and counting from his various crypto schemes. world liberty financial has raised over $550 million, with 75% of coin sales revenue flowing directly to the trump family.

This isn't normal business activity. This is systematic exploitation of presidential power for personal gain.

The foreign influence aspect is deeply concerning:

Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan of the UAE had his investment firm deposit $2 billion into world liberty financial in exchange for the white house giving UAE access to US technology. That's not investment - that's buying policy access.

DWF, a crypto firm facing allegations of market manipulation through ""wash trading,"" backed World Liberty Financial with $25 million. they explicitly stated they wanted ""direct dialogue with policymakers"" in return.

Most concerning? bloomberg reported that all but six of the top 25 $TRUMP token holders are using foreign exchanges that claim to exclude us customers. Foreign entities are literally buying access to the us president.

The regulatory capture is already happening:

democrats just blocked the bipartisan stablecoin legislation that the industry desperately needs for clarity. Why? because they're demanding stricter enforcement given these obvious conflicts.

60% of world liberty financial is owned by a Trump business entity. The president is literally regulating his own crypto business while profiting from it in real time.

the WSJ editorial board - not exactly known for attacking Republicans - called this ""especially ill-advised because the Administration will regulate crypto products and practices.""

this is damaging the entire crypto ecosystem:

when regulators appear compromised, it undermines institutional confidence in the entire space. We've worked years to build legitimacy, and this corruption threatens all of it.

Traditional finance is watching this unfold and questioning whether crypto regulation can ever be objective. that's terrible for long-term adoption and market stability.

What's particularly frustrating:

the crypto industry actually performs well under republican administrations typically. But this level of personal enrichment while in office is creating unnecessary political risk for everyone.

trump is using presidential power to dismantle the regulators who could stop his crypto empire. This isn't free market capitalism - it's crony capitalism at its worst.

The trading implications:

regulatory uncertainty is back in a big way. The bipartisan stablecoin framework was our best shot at clear rules, and now it's stalled indefinitely.

Expect increased volatility as this political drama unfolds. markets hate uncertainty, especially when it involves potential corruption at the highest levels.

international investors are going to question the integrity of us crypto markets if this continues unchecked.

I know some people here will say ""number go up"" justifies everything. but this corruption will eventually catch up with all of us through damaged regulatory relationships and international credibility loss.

even for everyday traders this makes life harder. when rules get distorted by politics, it creates confusion on how to report trades and comply with tax laws. tools like awaken.tax help individuals stay compliant in the chaos, but they can’t fix the damage caused when the regulatory system itself looks compromised.

the crypto space deserves better than being turned into a personal enrichment scheme for one family.

1nphbiq,Extreme slippage spikes on ETH/USDC Uniswap - what's causing these massive deviations?,"Hey DeFis,

I've been analyzing swap data from a ETH/USDC Uniswap Arbitrum pool and noticed these crazy price spikes that seem way off from the normal trading range. 

[https://imgur.com/a/u5WSwuT](https://imgur.com/a/u5WSwuT)

The chart shows the swap prices over time, and while most trades happen in the expected range (\~3400-4800 USDC/ETH), there are these massive deviations that spike both up and down.

That price was using the amount1/amount0 data from swap logs. 

You can see one example here, the tx was sucess, amount0 -1 and amount1 2, swap 1.5ETH for 0.000002 USDC ? 

[https://arbiscan.io/tx/0xe622f1fd4ea4038159e93b09c9b4305e6f66c55795ce083641f69a95206c1ebc#eventlog](https://arbiscan.io/tx/0xe622f1fd4ea4038159e93b09c9b4305e6f66c55795ce083641f69a95206c1ebc#eventlog)

Maybe someone used a wrong code to use the contracts for a swap? Is this correct? 

\- Could these be MEV bots/sandwich attacks in action?  
\- This can happen with low liquidity, but this is not the case. 

Has anyone else noticed similar patterns? Would love to hear thoughts from people more experienced with on-chain analysis.

1o20dko,BC2 – A Rare Price Behavior After the CoinEx Listing,"🚀 BC2 – A Rare Price Behavior After the CoinEx Listing



I’m not part of the team, but I’m genuinely enthusiastic about Bitcoin II (BC2) — and its recent price action deserves some attention.



📊 The Facts



* Just 3 weeks ago, BC2 was trading around $0.30.
* It then jumped from $0.60 to $2.30 in less than 24 hours.
* On October 4th, it peaked at around $2.30,
* And stayed above $2 for two full days (Oct 5–6).
* Then, after the CoinEx listing on Oct 7, the price dropped to $0.70.
* By October 8, it had already recovered to around $2.



⚙️ Why This Is Remarkable



This kind of controlled volatility and fast recovery is very rare for a new project.

Most coins experience a big hype pump on listing day, then collapse for weeks.

But BC2 bounced back quickly — showing:



Real organic demand,



An active community buying the dips,



And a healthy distribution without dominant whales.



🔍 Market Reading



The market corrected the pre-listing speculation, then quickly found a new balance.

The rebound above $1.50 suggests strong buying support and continued confidence in the project.

If volume remains stable, BC2 could be building a solid floor for the next growth phase.



🧠 In Short



BC2 has seen a fast rise, a listing-day dump, and a strong organic rebound —

a very unusual and encouraging pattern in today’s crypto landscape.



Even better, the team has announced they’re already working on listings on major exchanges like Binance and KuCoin, showing long-term commitment and real ambition to make BC2 a sustainable project with huge growth potential.",murphyl86,2025-10-09 15:19:42,6,0.88,4,CryptoMoonShots,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoonShots/comments/1o20dko/bc2_a_rare_price_behavior_after_the_coinex_listing/,https://reddit.com/r/CryptoMoonShots/comments/1o20dko/bc2_a_rare_price_behavior_after_the_coinex_listing/,True,Eth meme:rocket:,2025-10-11 07:02:42.750909,"BC2 – A Rare Price Behavior After the CoinEx Listing 🚀 BC2 – A Rare Price Behavior After the CoinEx Listing

24h trading volume is even crazier, up almost 10x from last week.

Over the past year, the privacy protocol has been used to mask around $2Bn worth of transactions, double the $1bn the year before.

Ethereum founder has come out in support of Railgun publicly on podcasts, events and on twitter. Not only has he highlighted its value as the best on-chain privacy protocol, but he has used it for milions of his own personal weath.

Despite all this, you may miss out on the gains...there is no mass marketing, there is no hype, there is no promotion, there is no dog meme logo.

If you read this post, then go out there and validate what i am saying against various sources and actually do your own research on Railgun and hoe it is changing the game for privacy, then you might have a chance. 

But if you run on reddit promotions, the 'work thats being done by a real community', hype and memes then this ones not for you.

1nvjjbc,Greg saw something strange last night…,"Hey everyone, it’s Greg.
I’ve been deep in my bunker for weeks, connecting dots, checking signals, keeping an eye on the usual suspects. You know… pigeons, 5G towers, weird frequencies in the water. The normal stuff.

But last night something felt different. I was tracking the usual channels when a light appeared outside. Not a drone, not a plane. It moved in ways I can’t explain. I don’t want to jump to conclusions yet, but it didn’t feel like anything from here.

Ni Wi, Pingu and Link are with me again. We’ve been going through old notes, trying to figure out what it could mean. The plan hasn’t changed: we’re bringing Greg back, sharing his stories again and seeing who’s still out there. No new coin, no big promises right now, just the mission to wake the Greg vibe up again and see if the old community wants to rebuild.

Season 2 is coming. The first new episode is finished and will drop soon. This time the story might go deeper than before.

If you’re new, welcome. If you’ve been here since the early days, it’s good to see you again. Trust Greg. Again.

1ne3lyg,Nr.2 The Smoking Hot Alpaca: Flying to close to the Green Candle,"Ca: HdDt1SjnUuvBBPzQB4WHneLvTesb6dzx2PH4ZvBDfnJU

Story: 
The Alpaca thought he had cracked the code.
While the herd chewed grass, he chewed candlesticks. He stared into the charts until they stared back. And one night, under the glow of green candles, he whispered:
“I figured out life.”

So he went all in.
Every sat, every coin, every last shred of wool — thrown into the furnace of the market. For a brief, shining moment, he was unstoppable. Portfolio screenshots dripped in dopamine, his fleece shimmered like liquid gold, and he strutted through the crypto fields puffing smoke like a king.

But markets are not kind.
They do not care for conviction, or memes, or dreams. In a single red candle, the mountain turned to rubble. His portfolio didn’t just dip — it evaporated. The Alpaca lost everything. The grass, the gold, even the will to chew. All that remained was smoke.

Now, he wanders the blockchain as The Smoking Hot Alpaca — forever burned by his own arrogance, forever tragic, forever a meme. He is the spirit of every bagholder who thought they were early, every trader who said “just one more leverage long,” every fool who believed number only goes up.

He is hot because he burned.
He is smoking because that is all that’s left.
And he is alpaca because… well, llama didn’t sound as cool.

The Smoking Hot Alpaca coin isn’t just a token.
It’s a shrine to every fellow ape who flew too close to the green candles — and got roasted alive.

1na3bdc,Portal To Bitcoin (PTB)  Strong Early Performance + Solid Launchpool APR,"Wanted to share some quick thoughts on $PTB after watching its first few days across exchanges. Day 1 closing price was $0.0256, and it’s already sitting around $0.0537 (+109%). For a project positioned as a “Portal to Bitcoin,” it’s interesting to see that kind of traction so early on, especially in a month that’s usually rough for alts.

What caught my attention most though was Bitget’s Launchpool. They’ve got APRs hovering ≥50% right now for staking $BGB/$PTB, which adds another passive income layer on top of the price action. Personally, I think that’s where CEX competition actually benefits users, you can pick where you want to maximize rewards.

Liquidity has been flowing strong too..  Bitget recorded the highest trading volume for PTB/USDT, which suggests that a lot of retail is already piling in there compared to other exchanges.

Obviously, it’s early and still volatile (as always, DYOR), but between the launch performance and the ongoing yield opportunities, PTB has turned out to be a better-than-expected listing so far.

What caught my attention most though was Bitget’s Launchpool. They’ve got APRs hovering ≥50% right now for staking $BGB/$PTB, which adds another passive income layer on top of the price action. Personally, I think that’s where CEX competition actually benefits users, you can pick where you want to maximize rewards.

Liquidity has been flowing strong too..  Bitget recorded the highest trading volume for PTB/USDT, which suggests that a lot of retail is already piling in there compared to other exchanges.

Obviously, it’s early and still volatile (as always, DYOR), but between the launch performance and the ongoing yield opportunities, PTB has turned out to be a better-than-expected listing so far. Curious to see how it holds up in the coming weeks once the hype cools.",portal bitcoin ptb strong early performance solid launchpool apr wanted share quick thought $ptb watching first day across exchange day 1 closing price $00256 already sitting around $00537 109 project positioned portal bitcoin interesting see kind traction so early especially month thats usually rough alt caught attention though bitgets launchpool theyve got apr hovering 50 right staking $bgb$ptb add another passive income layer top price action personally think thats cex competition actually benefit user pick want maximize reward liquidity flowing strong too bitget recorded highest trading volume ptbusdt suggests lot retail already piling compared exchange obviously early still volatile always dyor launch performance ongoing yield opportunity ptb turned betterthanexpected listing so far curious see hold coming week hype cool,positive,2,0.6489508783340454,1.0,positive,positive,positive,0.01091783493757248,0.3401312941789627,0.6489508783340454

The team has a very long-term vision and plan, which I believe is one of the most bullish signals a token can have. Since the fair launch, the number of holders has been steadily increasing. All of the supply is in circulation, with 0% tax, LP burned, and the contract renounced.

","**Bitcoin ETFs Witness More than $301M in Net Inflow on July 15**

In its exclusive X post, the firm noted that adding $301M in terms of inflows is a remarkable development. This reportedly denotes the 7^(th) continuous trading day seeing positive inflows. This highlights the sustained confidence and interest of investors in BTC ETFs. The ARKB ETF occupied the top position in this respect. It reportedly witnessed an inflow reaching about $100M once again following a pause for twenty-seven trading days.

This huge inflow signifies improved investor enthusiasm as well as a resilient market sentiment concerning ARK’s offering. Following that, BlackRock’s IBIT took the 2^(nd) position with net inflows of $117M. In the meantime, GBTC of Grayscale went through a break in inflows.

""btc is decentralized"" or sth, but it is logically to think that many large rich powerful group of people had already stored btc since it had become a thing, and they possess majority number of btc. 

So I think my question is:   
Is Bitcoin at risk of becoming centralized if a small number of whales own most of the supply? if yes then it is not that ""decentralized"" I think.

1mmdpk1,Question about DCA and Wallet,"Hey Bitcoin Community, 

I have a few questions for you guys with a bit more knowledge around this stuff!

I've ordered a cold wallet, arriving very soon and I'm excited to dive into bitcoin Im just not clear on some things, I'll keep it short

\- I'm constantly hearing good and bad reviews about the safety of cold wallets and i'm still not clear if i will have true, secure custody of my sats (not sure if i should mention wallet name?), Are there still risks with the newest wallets around? Looking to hold in this wallet for years to come ideally

\- If i do DCA do i have to do this manually every time? 

\- Does every purchase of Bitcoin need to be individually transferred manually to the wallet, removing it off the exchange? From what I've learnt every second it is on the exchange its in danger

\- Does the exchange you purchase from matter at all seeing's your removing your sats from it anyway? obviously low fees are ideal
