Sure ""nobody knows shit about fuck"", but after a decade you start to get a feel for this beast.","Sure ""nobody knows shit about fuck"", and yet people repeat the same mistakes, and the market keeps having familiar things coming back. Not quiet like clockwork, but close enough.

This is just my personal opinion based on what I learned, so take it with a heap of salt.

In **bold** is the direct answer.

# Is the bull cycle over?

With Fed rate cuts just starting? That's highly doubtful.

Plus there's a long list of things going right at the moment.

For a proper crash and a bubble to burst, you first need a proper bubble.

**We're probably not that far from it, but this market still needs a little more bubble.** Remember, what they say about market irrationality.

# When will the bull cycle end and crash?

Fed rates could potentially drag this out longer into early 2026, but don't expect that narrative to stay fresh for too long either.

Ultimately, the sooner we get some big rallies, FOMO, and mania (but milder than previous cycles because of tapering volatility), the closer we will be to a crash.

If this recent rally from $108K to $126K has another leg like that, we won't actually be too far from a proper bubble.

Because the market loves to create self-fulfilled prophecies, **I would set your clocks for a crash somewhere between mid-November to mid-January**. And clockwork is the one thing that has been somewhat reliable in this market.

Even if everything is rosy at the beginning of 2026, the forces of this market are too strong for a bull market to be extended for too long.

# How high Bitcoin will go?

Make sure you don't look at Bitcoin's history linearly, and start looking at the diminishing returns and tapering down of its volatility. It's a curve.

Now that we're deep in the bull market, the fog is beginning to lift.

For me the sweet spot of that peak is between **$129K-$149K**. If I had to go with an exact price: $136.9K.

I hope I'm not underestimating FOMO here, and overplaying the ""tapering down"" narrative.

$150K target seems too popular now.

# What about alt season? That's never gonna happen right?

Has no one else seen the glimpses and foreshadowing last November?

It was very revealing about the nature of the market and how it still behaves with alts. With just enough FOMO in the market, you get people panic buying alts.

The market has been a little more tamed since, with only one other little injection of FOMO and another alt rally during the summer.

A lower mania phase at the end of Bitcoin's bullrun could spell a milder and shorter alt season.

So **this alt season could really be milder** with ETH staying under $6K, but other major alts getting maybe only 30%-100% rallies, and a few lucky ones maybe getting 2x-3x. This in a scenario where Bitcoin only hits $136.9K.

**If we get some big BTC mania rally, then yes, there will be some big alt rallies.** Why? Because people are greedy.

# What about the bear winter, is it gonna be as brutal as usual?

Bitcoin *should* see its mildest winter. With a maximum drop down by only 60%-70%.

But what about MSTR, ETFs, big institutions and governments?

If that stuff implodes, it could create some **shit show** at maybe a higher level than FTX and LUNA.",fan_of_hakiksexydays,2025-10-09 21:59:25,340,0.83,153,cryptocurrency,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1o287jt/ive_been_in_this_market_since_2016_and_in_crypto/,https://reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1o287jt/ive_been_in_this_market_since_2016_and_in_crypto/,True,PERSPECTIVE,2025-10-10 15:07:26.257687,"I've been in this market since 2016 and in crypto even longer (and haven't raged quit yet).

Despite the price action, Ergo keeps evolving, new tech is added, apps are built on top of Ergo, Bridges (with unique design and security), DeFi, RWA, Games, Ergo is always evolving and upgrading.

Now Ergo just upgraded its node to 6.0 in what is called the Ergo Matrix 6.0. This is a game changer for Proof of Work blockchains. It brings to the real world what was thought to not be possible before. This upgrade brings speed, decentralization and security together, something very difficult to achieve and something that has not been done yet.

Instead of having a block doing every task slowly, Ergo introduced a new way for Proof of Work to work, the block splits itself with Input blocks for instant flow and ordering blocks for final truth in the blockchain, this increases the speed of the transaction by a huge magnitude. Theres no need for a Layer 2 to scale the blockchain, Ergo's blockchain now scales itself to a new level.

On top of that this upgrade also brings fractal pruning, meaning that the chain can now compress and clean its own history without losing verifiability. This eliminates the bloat that is added everyday to blockchains and keeps the size of the blockchain much lower than other blockchains, with time this makes a huge difference on running a node as less space is needed to download the blockchain itself which improves decentralization.

This upgraded proves that a proof of work blockchain can scale without having to trust a third party, maintaining the fundamentals intact.

there was more threads but lots of them got removed by mods and I got banned from some subs as well, that's how much people were against this back then.

I'm seeing a lot of posts lately from people asking about buying Bitcoin on credit. In 2015 when I just turned 18 I bought 85 Bitcoin @ around 235 each with a $20k student line of credit. Instead of going to college I used that money to buy Bitcoin and when i talked about it back then everyone said I was an idiot for doing it. But it worked out great because bitcoin was still a nascent technology at the time. Along with holding my initial position I doubled down many times and greatly grew my stack.

The problem with buying Bitcoin on credit these days is that the free market alone no longer really determines the price of btc and you are leaving yourself open to being wiped out by a financial entities manipulation. There are lots of government, corporate and central bank games being played with Bitcoin today. In the early bitcoin days things happened organically, it was simple supply and demand that caused the btc price to go up and down. There was also the fact it was a new technology and even if there wasn't demand for btc at some points back then you could still say you believe in the tech and if the tech was solid it would pay off down the line and bitcoin will go mainstream resulting in the btc price exploding.

Well that dream was realized and Bitcoin went mainstream. But the fact that bitcoin is mainstream now also means it has achieved deeper integration with financial institutions and the government. These entities are now manipulating the price of bitcoin like they did with traditional assets. Bitcoin can now have a manufactured downtrend in price caused by these financial institutions. Let's say you buy bitcoin on credit one day, you could be wiped out and lose everything not because of organic sell pressure but because of government/tradfi manipulation pushing the price down. This wasn't a problem back then but it is now. They have enough money to decide when btc pumps and when it dumps because they literally print fiat and unfortunately many in the space today only care about btc going up so they can dump it for fiat. This plays directly into the hands of the financial institutions and central banks. These are the entities that cause recessions, maybe they create another one once you buy on credit and you get wiped out that way. So these days it could be better to buy btc with your own money instead of on credit, so even if there is a downtrend you can still keep your btc and ride it to $1m per coin instead of having to sell it in a downtrend to pay off your credit resulting in you missing gains.

Also 10 years ago when Bitcoin was $200 each the marketcap was 3 billion, today the Bitcoin marketcap is 2.4 trillion. Almost 1000x bigger. Orders of magnitude of more money needs to be put into bitcoin today to move it the exact same percentage as back then. in 2015 if btc marketcap went up another 3 billion that would double the price. Today for the price to double another 2.4 Trillion needs to be added to the marketcap. Of course literally $2.4 T dollars don't need to be injected but you get what I'm saying, we're on a bigger scale now and it takes much more to move the price. We aren't seeing frequent 40% daily pumps and weekly 10x increase in price anymore for a reason.

For clarification I still think btc is going to $1m per bitcoin, so of course if you time your credit buys properly you'll come out ahead but do you really think you can time it? The risk of getting caught in a downturn is really big and that could wipe you out.

And sorry if this seemed like a doomer post, I don't want this to be taken as a bearish post because I'm still super bullish on Bitcoin and always have been. I just think the central banks are now greatly manipulating bitcoin and wiping people out so they can get even more of peoples bitcoin and control the supply as much as possible. This is all a big plan by them to manipulate Bitcoin like they do everything else, they don't want people owning btc they want it all for themselves. A lot of these ETFs, btc treasuries and other recent tradfi integrations of bitcoin will be used by the government to control the supply of Bitcoin.

And even though I say the risk of buying credit on bitcoin is huge today and I wouldn't recommend it some part of me still wants to beat this government and tradfi trash that is trying to corrupt Bitcoin lol. I think I can beat them at their own game so I still have some credit btc positions open. I'm happy I was able to use the tradfi system against them back then and use their credit to purchase real currency btc.

I'm suggesting that you could make a feature that you can turn on or off, and maybe compensates players with a little bonus RP or IP, or any other ideas you may have. Now, to talk numbers. I currently have a HP laptop with a basic Radeon graphics card, and I can mine at about 43 MHS (mega-hashes/second) at full power. So I could easily play league and mine at 0-5 MHS without noticing any performance difference. Now lets say you have 2 million players online at anytime, and 1 Million opt to have the mining in the background during a game on, averaging at 1 MHS (which is basically nothing by itself), But, with 1 million players running it, that would give you 1 Terra hash/second mining power, which at current price (bitcoin/usd) and difficulty is about 13-14,000 dollars a month in your pocket, and extra IP, RP, or whatever incentive you offer to the players in return.

1. As a part of the bitcoin community, I would like to see more exposure and more people learning about and using bitcoin, this would be a good opportunity for many people to learn about bitcoins and start using them.
2. I would be okay with you using this idea with no personal compensation to me, although I would hope if you did implement it, you would give me some sort of personal gain, or allow me to work with your company on this system.
3. As an avid player myself, I would enjoy the benefits of this system from a players perspective.

As we all saw from the years event we had some highs and some lows but , overall it was just another ATH unfortunately without all the fanfare or attention that the 2021 Bull Run received.

We are hoping that for the 2029 event we might get some more ""Hype"" and or Media attention. As for now bundle up, stay warm and enjoy the upcoming Crypto Winter. This winter you should expect the usual ""Why did you buy that?"", ""Buy the dip"", ""Just HODL"" and of course ""Bitcoin is dead"".

Selected Q&A from Bitcoin Stack Exchange:

\- Implications of OP\_RETURN changes in upcoming Bitcoin Core version 30.0?  
\- If OP\_RETURN relay limits are ineffective, why remove the safeguard instead of keeping it as a default discouragement?  
\- What are the worst-case stress scenarios from uncapped OP\_RETURNs in Bitcoin Core v30?  
\- If OP\_RETURN needed more room, why was the 80-byte cap removed instead of being raised to 160?  
\- If arbitrary data is inevitable, does removing OP\_RETURN limits shift demand toward more harmful storage methods (like UTXO-inflating addresses)?  
\- If OP\_RETURN uncapping doesn‚Äôt increase the UTXO set, how does it still contribute to blockchain bloat and centralization pressure?  
\- How does uncapping OP\_RETURN impact long-term fee-market quality and security budget?  
\- Assurance blockchain will not suffer from illegal content with 100KB OP\_RETURN?  
\- What analysis shows OP\_RETURN uncapping won‚Äôt harm block propagation or orphan risk?   
\- Where does Bitcoin Core keep the XOR obfuscation keys for both block data files and level DB indexes?  
\- How robust is 1p1c transaction relay in bitcoin core 28.0?

1o2rfpe,Bitcoin has no intrinsic value as it is not real.,"I know that most of you have come across this statement that Bitcoin has no intrinsic value as it is not real. For most of our history we have attached value to tangible goods.

Bitcoin is intangible and yet it has value. Obviously millions in the free market have decided that it has value, so obvious by its price of well over 100K USD.

1o2o1yi,"The Decoupling is Done: Why $4,000+ Gold and Bitcoin Are Now Both Anti-Fiat, Not Anti-Dollar","Gold's rally past $4,000 has decoupled from the US Dollar, confirming that hard assets are now functioning as a systemic hedge against sovereign instability and monetary policy failure,  a direct boon for the Bitcoin thesis.

What I've seen in the data that confirms this structural shift:

1) The Failed Correlation: Historically, a strong USD suppresses gold. Currently, gold is above $4,000/oz, and the USD maintains its strongest position in two months. This simultaneous strength signals gold is now an anti-fiat hedge, not an anti-dollar trade.  

2) Institutional Validation: Gold's resilience is rooted in historic central bank demand to diversify away from dollar-denominated assets. Bitcoin is benefiting from the same flight to non-sovereign risk.  

3) The Institutional Options Bet: The options market for Bitcoin ETFs is confirming this conviction. The term structure is upward sloping, and the medium-term November expiry shows calls are pricier than puts, signaling institutional positioning for continued upside.

1o2u8s0,Bitcoin vs. Traditional Markets ‚Äì Long-Term Risk & Efficiency Analysis,"I analyzed several **long-term risk and performance metrics** to understand how major asset classes behave over multi-decade horizons.  
The goal was to measure not just volatility or returns, but **efficiency** ‚Äî how much reward investors receive for each unit of drawdown and recovery risk.

The comparison includes **Bitcoin**, **NASDAQ 100**, **S&P 500**, **DAX**, and **Gold** ‚Äî representing innovation, broad equity markets, regional exposure (*a bit biased here as a german*), and traditional store-of-value assets.

  
**Asset Risk Summary**

**Bitcoin:** Exceptional annualized growth (> 150 % CAGR, though most of that in the early years, to be honest) despite extreme volatility (‚àí 93 % max drawdown). Fastest recovery speed and unmatched risk-adjusted efficiency.  
**NASDAQ 100:** High growth (\~ 14 % CAGR) and elevated risk but solid efficiency ‚Äî ideal for aggressive growth investors.  
**S&P 500:** Moderate growth (\~ 5‚Äì6 % CAGR) with long recovery phases ‚Äî a defensive core for patient investors.  
**DAX:** Cyclical mid-range performance; long drawdown durations typical of industrial markets.  
**Gold:** Reliable crisis hedge (\~ 4 % CAGR) with low efficiency; stability over returns, even considering recent price surge.

# Takeaway

Bitcoin displays **asymmetric performance**:

* Highest historical volatility,
* Yet the **strongest long-term efficiency** and **fastest recovery profile**.

In contrast, traditional indices deliver smoother but slower growth, while gold remains a defensive stabilizer.  
Together, they define the full **risk spectrum** ‚Äî from security to speculation to exponential growth potential.



**Definitions:**

|KPI|Definition|Interpretation|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate)**|Average annual growth rate between the first and last value over the full period.|Measures how fast an asset grows per year on average.|
|**Max Drawdown**|Largest percentage drop from a previous peak to a trough.|Indicates worst-case historical loss before recovery.|
|**Ulcer Index**|Root mean square of all drawdowns below prior peaks.|Captures both depth and duration of drawdowns (‚Äúpain‚Äù).|
|**Pain Ratio**|CAGR √∑ Ulcer Index.|Shows how much return is earned per unit of drawdown stress.|
|**MAR Ratio (Managed Account Ratio)**|CAGR √∑|Max Drawdown|

The goal was to measure not just volatility or returns, but **efficiency** ‚Äî how much reward investors receive for each unit of drawdown and recovery risk.

The comparison includes **Bitcoin**, **NASDAQ 100**, **S&P 500**, **DAX**, and **Gold** ‚Äî representing innovation, broad equity markets, regional exposure (*a bit biased here as a german*), and traditional store-of-value assets.

  
**Asset Risk Summary**

**Bitcoin:** Exceptional annualized growth (> 150 % CAGR, though most of that in the early years, to be honest) despite extreme volatility (‚àí 93 % max drawdown). Fastest recovery speed and unmatched risk-adjusted efficiency.  
**NASDAQ 100:** High growth (\~ 14 % CAGR) and elevated risk but solid efficiency ‚Äî ideal for aggressive growth investors.  
**S&P 500:** Moderate growth (\~ 5‚Äì6 % CAGR) with long recovery phases ‚Äî a defensive core for patient investors.  
**DAX:** Cyclical mid-range performance; long drawdown durations typical of industrial markets.  
**Gold:** Reliable crisis hedge (\~ 4 % CAGR) with low efficiency; stability over returns, even considering recent price surge.

# Takeaway

Bitcoin displays **asymmetric performance**:

* Highest historical volatility,
* Yet the **strongest long-term efficiency** and **fastest recovery profile**.

In contrast, traditional indices deliver smoother but slower growth, while gold remains a defensive stabilizer.  
Together, they define the full **risk spectrum** ‚Äî from security to speculation to exponential growth potential.

1o27l08,BTC Fear and Greed index,"https://www.cointree.com/learn/crypto-fear-and-greed-index/

I posted yesterday to evaluate group opinions on BTC price action next year. It seems moderately split - some think down, some think sideways, some think up.

The best (safest) advice seems to be hold and accumulate.

Now, the next question. For those that have dry powder for next year, how are you timing your buys?

1. Lump sum buy when BTC Fear and Greed is ""Fear"" or ""Extreme Fear"". This has served me extremely well so far. Timing Bitcoin is responsible for all of my gains thus far.

2. Straight DCA with set timing of buys.

I'm trying to optimize my strategy. #1 has the benefit of waiting for downswings, #2 eliminates risk of trying to time the market, but might not have as large of gains. It would have advantage though if price were to slide aggressively downward in a prolonged bear market.

Curious how other people are playing this next year. Wisdom of the crowd is my idea here.

1o1q9ry,My thoughts,"I've been heavily into btc for 5 years now, though I first heard of it in 2017.

Take this for what it is:

General framework:

A lot of people want to brag how much bitcoin they have. I cannot stress this is a TERRIBLE idea. It will only negatively effect your income if w2 worker, negatively effect friendships, and also put you into grave risk of physical harm.

  
1. Physical risk. I have known people who were robbed, and one murdered, because of perceived money.

Over time more and more will become desperate. 

Saying how much btc you have is a risk.

Have a cool car? Keep it inside your garage.

Have a cool watch? Don't wear it on the ny subway unless you want your hand chopped off.

  
2. Workplace -your boss doesn't want to hear about bitcoin, nor do your coworkers. Have 5 btc? Understand for most people the idea of having one coin is a far flung fantasy. It will create resentment and anger. It will also cost you potential opportunities. 



3. Friendships. I had several friends that missed the opportunity and will continue to miss it. They are starting to become very angry because the reality is that they are working in rat cages, have 40% of their income stolen through taxes, and 15% in real inflation. Their income is drastically falling in btc terms.

Wealth divisions create problems. Keep your mouth shut.



4. Scams. I was recently hit for a scam attack. I am uber paranoid. Let me say it was GOOD. Be wary of social media. Delete yourself off of it. 



5. Luxury purchases/fast $. Remember why you got into btc. Mine was simple. I wanted a risk to get the fuck out of the fucking rat race.

I just had a close friend call me. his house is going into foreclosure. he's losing his business. He's 37. He could have had a nice house paid off. The lure of riches fucked his life.

1o29c9z,Safe way to sell my bitcoin?,"Hi. Is there any safe way to sell my bitcoin? I'm thinking of selling some of it, but I'm stumped on how to do it. Each method has its own risks in my opinion. 

If I wanted to sell it through an exchange with KYC, apart from the verification itself, I'm afraid of the bank blocking the incoming payment. If I wanted to sell it through bitcoinmat, they may also block the BTC with wanting to prove their origin. If I want to use a P2P exchange like Bisq, there is a risk that someone will send me fiat originating from criminal activity and the bank will make me return the payment, but I will have already sent the bitcoin to the scammer in the meantime. If I want to sell bitcoin in person for cash, e.g. via Vexl, there is a risk of the other person giving me fake notes, and I'm also quite scared of meeting complete strangers. 

The easiest option would be to sell it to someone I know personally, but unfortunately I don't know anyone like that.

1o1pury,"My Concerns with some Claims in the Book ""The Fiat Standard""","The following is mostly just a vent regarding some claims made in the book ""The Fiat Standard"" by Saifedean Ammous. I read ""The Bitcoin Standard"" years ago mostly enjoyed the read, so I decided to give this a whirl. I am halfway through at this point.

Okay, so I know the authors have a lot of valid points in this book. However, as I'm reading about how fiat currencies caused our food to become less nutritionally dense... I can't help but feel like this book is blaming all of the world's problems on fiat currency. That along with the claims about building architecture and quality... these were some of the most unfounded claims I've heard in a nonfiction book. Like, sure I can see the argument... but where's the proof?? Like, describing how buildings built before the fiat transition were built to last long and then buildings after the fact were 'ugly' and 'prone to repairs'... Okay, so you cherry picked two buildings, completely ignored all other context surrounding when and how they were built, and claim it's because of the time preference shift caused by fiat currency? c'mon man... that's the conspiracy theory playbook. draw connections to all of society's problems to this one thing. The confirmation bias / working backwards from a thesis to find evidence is strong at times here.

Yes, I think fiat currency causes a lot of issues, but to claim that this can be tied to virtually every other disparate problem with society feels very biased and like the authors are fixated on this evil phenomenon that is fiat currency.

This doesn't automatically invalidate the issues that the book claims, but it certainly makes me feel less convinced about other claims. I would still read the book as it does offer a new way to think about money, just as the bitcoin standard did. But it definitely has some moments that leave you wondering why they decided this was worth putting in the book.

I read ""The Bitcoin Standard"" years ago mostly enjoyed the read, so I decided to give this a whirl. I am halfway through at this point.

Okay, so I know the authors have a lot of valid points in this book. However, as I'm reading about how fiat currencies caused our food to become less nutritionally dense... I can't help but feel like this book is blaming all of the world's problems on fiat currency. That along with the claims about building architecture and quality... these were some of the most unfounded claims I've heard in a nonfiction book. Like, sure I can see the argument... but where's the proof?? Like, describing how buildings built before the fiat transition were built to last long and then buildings after the fact were 'ugly' and 'prone to repairs'... Okay, so you cherry picked two buildings, completely ignored all other context surrounding when and how they were built, and claim it's because of the time preference shift caused by fiat currency? c'mon man... that's the conspiracy theory playbook. draw connections to all of society's problems to this one thing. The confirmation bias / working backwards from a thesis to find evidence is strong at times here.

Yes, I think fiat currency causes a lot of issues, but to claim that this can be tied to virtually every other disparate problem with society feels very biased and like the authors are fixated on this evil phenomenon that is fiat currency.

This doesn't automatically invalidate the issues that the book claims, but it certainly makes me feel less convinced about other claims. I would still read the book as it does offer a new way to think about money, just as the bitcoin standard did. But it definitely has some moments that leave you wondering why they decided this was worth putting in the book.

Since Bitcoin is ""decentralized"", where is its blockchain data stored?

If one day, assuming all nodes go offline - will Bitcoin ""disappear""? Or, as long as one node is still there, it can be restarted?

If I had to guess, in prior red years, traders sold thinking that the squeeze effect from the halving had ran it's course. Enough selling drove the price down, despite increase in hash rate.

ETFs have given traders much easier access to Bitcoin. Dips are easier to buy. Sketchy exchanges, which hurt price action badly in 2022, are less likely to recur with regulations coming in place since.

Bitcoin is seen as a long term investment by more and more people, who might elect to hold rather than sell.

1o2faq8,May this day never come.,"‚ÄúBlackBerry phones stopped working reliably after BlackBerry shut down its operating system and services for older phones on January 4, 2022, and the company no longer produces phones. The brand's downfall was a combination of factors, including failing to adapt to the touchscreen revolution, losing market share to the iPhone and other competitors, poor management decisions, and a lack of modern features like good cameras and sufficient developer support.  
Key Reasons for BlackBerry's Decline
Failure to Adapt to Touchscreens: BlackBerry's signature physical keyboards proved cumbersome against the intuitive, full-touchscreen interfaces of smartphones like the iPhone. 
Competition: The arrival of the iPhone and other competitors offering a superior user experience and a wider range of apps led to a massive loss of market share for BlackBerry. 
Poor Management and Vision: The company failed to develop a clear vision for the future of mobile computing, focusing too much on niche business needs rather than the broader consumer market. 
Lack of Modern Features: Early BlackBerry phones struggled with poor cameras, limited app ecosystems, and slow performance compared to newer devices, according to Quora users‚Äù

1o1h6ub,We just launched one of the fastest ways to buy ETH,"Hey everyone,

I‚Äôm Brian (bsmokes), Founder of Pistachio. We‚Äôve just gone live with an integration that I think meaningfully improves the onboarding experience for Ethereum users.

We integrated Coinbase Ramp directly into Pistachio to make getting funds onto Base simple and fast.

Here‚Äôs what it looks like today:

* Instant deposits of USDC and ETH directly to Base (up to $500/week)
* Apple Pay support (debit cards only for now)
* No ID checks required for US residents (including NY!)
* No fees for the first $50,000 deposited  
* All settling natively on Base without extra hops or bridge delays  

Why this matters:

* Coinbase Ramp provides a secure and compliant fiat-to-crypto flow, but funds arrive in a **self-custody smart wallet**, not a custodial account  
* Deposits go straight to Base, avoiding mainnet friction and unnecessary costs for new users
* Waiving early fees allows people to test the flow without losing value on the way in  

Onboarding remains one of the hardest problems in crypto. Our goal is to remove barriers for new users while keeping the experience fully onchain and user-owned.

The integration is live today. I would love feedback from this community, whether it‚Äôs testing the flow or critiquing the approach (L2, L2, I know). We are building for scale, but also want to make sure we get it right for early adopters.

1nxv7br,3-phase commit for true Raiden network,"All decentralized multihop payments like Raiden/Lightning (and also Ryan Fugger's base layer) have historically used a 2-phase commit that defaults to cancel the payment to manage the attack vector of money reserved for payment being stuck for all eternity. This solution brings with it the risk of a penalty (note, only on *one* of the phases) that may end up imposed on an innocent intermediary. The original solution to this in 2006 was to make the penalty gradual, a microscopic amount per second, but the problem is that the cumulative time until the payment times out then tends to get so long that the timeout itself no longer serves to solve the ""reserve payment attack"", and while the penalty could be a sufficient solution *there was only a penalty on one of the phases*. So, people settled for ""staggered timeouts"" as a work around, but this does not fix the problem, network failures or denial of service attacks can still cause an innocent intermediary to end up paying for the full payment.

The solution is to add the penalty on both phases. This is easily done once you realize that the *other* 2-phase commit, that finishes on timeout, also only has a penalty on one of the phases but it has it on the *opposite* phase. Thus, you can simply **combine** them and add a phase in between that shifts the action of the timeout, thus you get a 3-phase commit.

I built Ryan Fugger's base layer already (just 2500 lines of code with zero dependencies) and adding ""collateral"" (""state proof"" on top of the ""base payment channel"") is very easy. Raiden could be built and finished with minimal work. If anyone is interested. My goal is already achieved with the base layer (as my vision only required it to exits) but I could help out with pointers if anyone wants to get a real Raiden created.

I have more material, video presentation, complete implementation, etc, if anyone is interested. And I can walk anyone through it as well in chat for example here in discussion thread, the 3-phase commit is **very simple** it was just a bit hard to discover as people tend to follow the path already made by others (the cancel-on-timeout 2-phase commit, whereas I approached the other one and naturally noticed both together would *transcend* the limitations of either).

It‚Äôs a suite of five specialist CLI tools, written in Rust for performance, designed to be the only thing you need¬†*before*¬†you deploy:

1. `sol-sentry`: An automated security scanner that catches common vulns.
2. `gas-forecaster`: Get accurate, multi-chain deployment cost estimates in USD.
3. `sol-console`: An interactive REPL for your contracts with instant mainnet forking.
4. `receipt-parse`: A human-readable transaction decoder.
5. `event-tail`: A real-time¬†`tail -f`¬†for on-chain events.

My goal was to create a zero-dependency, cohesive system that's built for professional developers who live in the terminal.

The core of the suite is free to use forever. For advanced features like test generation and CI/CD integration, there's a Pro license. This ensures the project can be professionally maintained and supported for the long haul.

I explain the whole philosophy on the launch blog post. Would love for you to check it out and give me your honest feedback.

i sat down with my friend chris blake, a math phd/chainlink research contributor/blockchain academic, to unpack everything from:

* why smart contracts could slash society‚Äôs costs by orders of magnitude
* what might actually drive adoption, and
* how to break into the industry

this convo is a bit zaney, unorthodox, and all at the same time deeply insightful and fun.

what happens when an eccentric ""mad scientist""-vibes math phd dives headfirst into crypto?

i sat down with my friend chris blake, a math phd/chainlink research contributor/blockchain academic, to unpack everything from:

* why smart contracts could slash society‚Äôs costs by orders of magnitude
* what might actually drive adoption, and
* how to break into the industry

this convo is a bit zaney, unorthodox, and all at the same time deeply insightful and fun.

1ntrux8,[Survey] Building a Tool to Make Crypto Safer for Beginners - Need Your Feedback!,"Hi everyone,

I'm a student doing an incubator project called¬†[CryptoRating](https://cryptorating.colab.duke.edu/), and I'm currently in the market analysis stage.

My project aims to solve a common problem: the crypto world is incredibly complex and intimidating for newcomers. Information is scattered, it's hard to tell good projects from bad ones, and there's a real risk of scams.

I'm working on a free, all-in-one platform designed to make crypto safer and easier to understand for beginners by combining risk ratings, curated news, and simple explanations.

To make sure I'm building something that's actually useful, I've created a quick, anonymous survey. It has 10 questions and will only take about 1.5 minutes to complete.

Here's the link to the survey: \[[https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd2ThoGKq2X5LU6N01kFiuGy5nCVdyN8Sz\_TKtdB\_bCvE8RhA/viewform?usp=dialog\]](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd2ThoGKq2X5LU6N01kFiuGy5nCVdyN8Sz_TKtdB_bCvE8RhA/viewform?usp=dialog])

Treasuries, private credit, and real estate are already being experimented with on-chain, and even uranium can now be purchased as a tokenized asset in fractional amounts.

Ethereum appears to be the main settlement layer for a lot of these projects. Institutions tend to trust its security, liquidity, and established ecosystem compared to newer chains. Some people see this as a major step toward bringing traditional markets on-chain, while others worry that RWAs introduce new risks like centralization around custodians, regulatory hurdles, and proof of reserve issues.

AMA this week!

I‚Äôm Winny (aka Winny.eth), founder and CEO of Chipped. I‚Äôve spent the last few years building at the intersection of fashion, hardware, and crypto by creating products that make Web3 social, wearable, and fun.

Chipped is a wearables company for SocialFi: we embed NFC microchips into press-on nails (and soon other accessories), turning them into tappable profiles, networking tools, and reward portals. With one tap, you can share your socials, drop links, claim rewards, or even send/receive payments.¬†

Over the past year we‚Äôve:

‚Ä¢ Shipped thousands of chipped nails worldwide

‚Ä¢ Partnered with Paris Hilton‚Äôs e-commerce team and Black Mirror

‚Ä¢ Been worn by creators on Love Island and featured in Forbes

AMA anything about: building hardware + software for consumer crypto, creating viral wearable tech products, what it‚Äôs like running IRL activations at fashion weeks and crypto conferences, or where SocialFi is heading next ‚ù§Ô∏è

1nmv28o,"Solana 150ms world wide finality time, centralization vectors","I'm not allowed to post in the Solana subreddit because I've asked too many questions and I'm trying to understand how this would work as it can be extended to Ethereum L2 as well. I actually do appreciate some of the technical advancements Solana has made, I just personally think Solana is way more centralized than people realize and it should become an Ethereum L2 to properly guarantee property rights and give users the option to exit to a credibly neutral L1 chain like Ethereum. Anyway, I was listening to Anatoly at the All In Summit and he was mentioning Solana's goal is to achieve 150ms finality time, specifically using Starlink. I was looking at world wide ping times and they're closer to 250ms (though I understand that Starlink can be closer to 150ms because of low Earth orbit).

What I am trying to understand, whether it's Solana or even an Ethereum L2, is it even possible to achieve 150ms global finality if you can't even communicate across the world that quickly? Even if you just used Starlink, which is a massive centralization choke point as you wouldn't be able to achieve 150ms through traditional fiber, and restricted yourself to top tier datacenters which is another choke point, is this even possible? I don't understand how you synchronize the ledger that quickly without introducing other issues, arbitrage opportunities, and massive centralization risks.",DepartedQuantity,2025-09-21 22:33:30,17,0.67,9,ethereum,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1nmv28o/solana_150ms_world_wide_finality_time/,https://reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1nmv28o/solana_150ms_world_wide_finality_time/,True,,2025-10-10 15:07:33.360526,"Solana 150ms world wide finality time, centralization vectors I'm not allowed to post in the Solana subreddit because I've asked too many questions and I'm trying to understand how this would work as it can be extended to Ethereum L2 as well.

1nlv483,Suspicious ERC20 transfers from both hot and cold wallets ‚Äì need help understanding,"¬†need urgent help understanding some **suspicious token transfers** that are happening from my wallets.

EDIT: Mystery solved TIL,  Token Contract creators, can move around tokens at their will, also FROM other people's wallets.  nothing to worry about. Read further just if you are curious. 

* A few days ago, I saw an **outgoing ERC20 token transfer** from my hot MetaMask wallet. The token was one I had never interacted with before ([token address: 0xc09d668a04360475819f1de5a6f5ee11cbefcf0c](https://etherscan.io/token/0xc09d668a04360475819f1de5a6f5ee11cbefcf0c)). It was flagged to a phishing address.
* This morning, a **similar outgoing transfer** happened, but this time from a **different wallet**: my cold Ledger wallet, which is completely air-gapped and which I haven‚Äôt used directly.
* Even stranger: while I was drafting this post, a **third outgoing transfer** of the same type just happened again, back on the hot wallet.
* Another suspicious token I saw being transferred is here: [token address: 0xd1396f7cd157eea7d096326ddec871c9fe22eda8](https://etherscan.io/token/0xd1396f7cd157eea7d096326ddec871c9fe22eda8).

EDIT: Find some screenshots of tx types:

[https://imgur.com/a/ANoty5Y](https://imgur.com/a/ANoty5Y)

The only link between these wallets is that they **have interacted with each other in the past**, but I don‚Äôt understand how both can now be showing these weird outgoing internal transfers of scammy ERC20 tokens.

What I know / observed:

* These don‚Äôt show up as ‚Äúnormal‚Äù transactions I signed.
* They only appear in **Token Transfers** on Etherscan.
* No ETH has been stolen so far ‚Äî I even tested by putting a small amount back, and it wasn‚Äôt drained.
* Some months back I had received a huge incoming transfer of these junk tokens (1M units), which I ignored at the time.

Now I‚Äôm seriously worried:

* Could both wallets really be compromised, even the cold Ledger?
* Is this instead some kind of ‚Äúphantom‚Äù transfer (like dust / spam ERC20s moving around) that doesn‚Äôt mean my keys are compromised?
* Or maybe something related to allowances / approvals that I don‚Äôt remember granting?

üëâ If anyone wants to dig into this more deeply, I can share the full transaction details by DM. I‚Äôll happily send a **small ETH tip** to whoever helps me understand and monitor what‚Äôs going on.

1nl8g49,Huge news for Ethereum!,"**Fusaka upgrade is set to go live on December 3, 2025.**

Ethereum core developers outlined the roadmap during ACDC #165 call:

‚Ä¢ Sept 22 - Code freeze.

‚Ä¢ Sept 25 - Testnet client releases.

‚Ä¢ Oct 1 - Holesky fork.

‚Ä¢ Oct 14 - Sepolia fork.

‚Ä¢ Oct 28 - Hoodi fork.

‚Ä¢ Early Nov - Mainnet clients.

‚Ä¢ Dec 3 - Fusaka Mainnet activation (tentative).

**Alongside Fusaka, developers will also introduce Blob Parameter Only (BPO) forks - smaller, consensus-only upgrades designed to fine-tune blob targets and limits.**

This will help the network scale blob usage incrementally.

**The main question, what‚Äôs inside Fusaka?**   
  
**In total, it includes 11 EIPs:**

‚Ä¢ EIP-7594: PeerDAS.

‚Ä¢ EIP-7642: eth/69 (History Expiry & Simpler Receipts).

‚Ä¢ EIP-7823: Set Upper Bounds for MODEXP.

‚Ä¢ EIP-7825: Transaction Gas Limit Cap.

‚Ä¢ EIP-7883: ModExp Gas Cost Increase.

‚Ä¢ EIP-7892: Blob Parameter Only Forks.

‚Ä¢ EIP-7917: Deterministic Proposer Lookahead.

‚Ä¢ EIP-7918: Blob Base Fee Bound.

‚Ä¢ EIP-7934: RLP Execution Block Size Limit.

‚Ä¢ EIP-7935: Default Gas Limit Update.

1nl9ops,Where are people staking ETH nowadays?,"I‚Äôm not really a crypto person and don‚Äôt follow the news much, but about 5 years ago I bought 1 ETH and staked it on Kraken, then just left it. I recently checked my account and was pretty happy with the staking rewards that piled up.

Now I‚Äôve got a few more ETH sitting on my Ledger and I‚Äôd like to stake them as well. What‚Äôs the best way to do this nowadays?

I know I could just send them to Kraken to stake, but I‚Äôd rather not keep them on an exchange. Through Ledger I see options like Lido and Coinbase, but from what I understand, those involve converting ETH into some sort of token, which I‚Äôm not too comfortable with.

Also, I heard the unstaking queue is super long now - like up to 2 months? But when I checked Kraken, it said more like a week. Why is there such a big difference?

1nl8y44,The Bar For Privacy Is Going Up,"As A longtime advocate for (and investor in) blockchain privacy, I‚Äôm really happy to see the growing focus on privacy in the Ethereum ecosystem. Today Plume announced that they are adding the Nightfall privacy technology developed by EY to their ecosystem. I‚Äôm really happy to see that and to be helping them along with that process.

Despite the increased focus on privacy, too many people still think that mixers and some other limited privacy pools will be enough. They aren‚Äôt. The new benchmark you need to start moving towards is that assets and transactions must go into privacy environments - AND STAY THERE.

Every time you move an asset into or out of a privacy environment, you‚Äôre essentially using it as a mixer, but those types of movements are increasingly easy to track using sophisticated analytical tools. They are far from perfect, but perfect isn‚Äôt required to figure with whom you are transacting. This picture, which I took at the TUM Blockchain in Munich shows how Chainalysis can track funds as they move through mixers and bridges. It‚Äôs a leaky process, but it works. And that‚Äôs just with criminals and fungible assets.

[Chainalysis‚Äô Reactor Tool Tracks Payments & Transfers](https://preview.redd.it/xfoei20yi5qf1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9901d1dbed21cc0e5ad1174cd2df11c6af17bd91)

If you‚Äôre a business and you deal in non-fungible assets or you do a lot of routine transactions with the same customers and suppliers, don‚Äôt think for one second that pattern won‚Äôt be discernible even faster. As a result, systems that operate a bit like mixers or that use ZK to conceal selected transfer data are not going to be effective for people who do anything more than routine transactions.

To maintain privacy, you need execute transactions inside the privacy environment. Networks like Aztec allow you to build complex business transactions with programmable logic inside the privacy environment.  Nightfall allows you to do payments, transfers, and swaps and, over the next year or so, we‚Äôll be adding the ability to build complex, composable contracts that run entirely under privacy

In the early stages, if you value your privacy, you should reasonably expect to pay a bit more for private transactions. At least for Nightfall, the most expensive part of the transaction is actually the computing power required for the roll-up, not the gas fees. However, I‚Äôm optimistic that these costs will come down quickly. We‚Äôve seen performance improvements on ZK computations of over 1,000x in the last few years. I expect that to continue.

The Nightfall test network on Plume is already up and running.  Expect to see announcements from EY and Plume on education programs and access to the test net shortly. 

Between Nightfall, Aztec, COTI, and others, the privacy space is really heating up on Ethereum. I can‚Äôt deny that, as one of the proud parents of Nightfall, I want to see us win that race, but I‚Äôll be happy no matter which option succeeds because first and foremost, I think sustainable, scalable privacy is critical to driving blockchain adoption at scale.

1njrtj0,How to Get Users on Ethereum,"There was a thread about how to get users to use Ethereum over Solana, and I thought I'd do a brain dump on my thoughts and have all of you critique my ideas and tell me I'm wrong.

##Fundamentals  

There are 4 things that users look for in a blockchain:

1. Transaction Cost - How much does it take to update blockchain state?
2. Finality Speed - How long does it take to know my state change is forever?
3. Credible Neutrality - Is there a chance that the network will be biased against me?
4. Actionable - Are there things for me to do on the chain.

## Let's take a look at some blockchains:

**Bitcoin:**  
  
- Transaction Cost: High ‚Üë  
- Finality Speed: High ‚Üë  
- Credible Neutrality: Yes ‚úì  
- Actionable: No êÑÇ 

Bitcoin was (is) slow and expensive, but it was objectivley neutral for the first 5-ish years of its life - anyone could mine it, even if it meant buying an ASIC and Bitcoin miners weren't discriminating against addresses or users. Things have changed as centralized relayers with blacklists have come into play and mining has become very centralized.

**Ethereum:**  
- Transaction Cost: Medium ‚Üí   
- Finality Speed: Medium ‚Üí  
- Credible Neutrality: Yes ‚úì  
- Actionable: Yes ‚úì  
	
Ethereum launched when people were already fed up with Bitcoin transaction costs and finality speed. Bitcoin promised being a replacement for cash, but failed to uphold that promise and refused to scale. Ethereum had, at the time, very low fees and low finality speed when compared to Bitcoin, and it was neutral because anyone was able to GPU mine and participate in the network.  
  
**Solana:**  
- Transaction Cost: Low ‚Üì  
- Finality Speed: Low (let's ignore failed txns for this discussion) ‚Üì  
- Credible Neutrality: No êÑÇ  
- Actionable: Yes ‚úì  
	
Solana offers very cheap transactions with low finality speed (again, ignoring all the failures), but has no neutrality. A PoS network without slashing means one of the following are true:

1. The network uses a cryptographic mechanism to make cheating impossible.
2. The network allows cheating.
3. The network relies on an off-chain mechanism to ensure valdiators are punished.

Solana uses option #3 via the Solana Foundation, which means they have unmatched power over the network, and they have unmatched power over all users on the network.

## What about L2s?

- Transaction Cost: Low ‚Üì
- Finality Speed: Low ‚Üì
- Credible Neutrality: Depends êÑÇ
- Actionable: Yes ‚úì
	
Looking at the equation with an L2 lens doesn't look much better than the Ethereum or Solana result - they tend to have fewer assets, less liquidity, some are neutral/some aren't, and even the ones with exit hatches don't appeal to retail because they don't plan on using it and would struggle to figure out how. L2s bring fragmentation without bringing any user-facing benefits to users. That will go away with time, but users want to make money now. Telling users that Ethereum will eventually scale and L2s will eventually be unified just makes the Ethereum space look behind while also being older than Solana.

**Side note**: I sometimes wonder if having an exit hatch makes L2s look less reliable than Solana. If L2s are so good, why are they worried about being down? (that's a rhetorical question)  
  

## What is the Primary Market?  

Since Solana has gained traction with retail users, that tells me that the current blockchain market values `(low txn cost + low finality speed) > credible neutrality`.

Back in 2013, this would have shocked me. When Ethereum launched, this would have shocked me, especially since developers seem to have the same view of the inequality.

Retail users care about one thing: How can I make as much money as possible?

This is where ""actionable"" comes in. There is nothing to do on the Bitcoin blockchain, so retail doesn't care about it. There's a lot to do on Ethereum, but the cost to develop new tokens on Ethereum makes it too expensive for fly-by-night pump and dump scams, which retail loves - it's the only way they know to make money. Solana, being very cheap and having plenty of new things to speculate on, makes it a very tempting place for gambling.

A retail user who currently transacts on Solana has zero incentive to move to Ethereum based on the fundamental difference that Ethereum is neutral (therefore safer) because the lack of neutrality won't affect their profits.

- They don't care that a small validator set controls their money.
- They don't care that the chain can halt at any time and lock them out of their money. They care during the outage, but quickly forget.
- They don't care that they have to resubmit transactions all the time because Solana doesn't have a mempool - retrying is cheap.
- They don't care that the Solana Foundation may someday stop subsidizing validators which will make running a validator a money-losing venture.
- They don't care that the chain will shut down permanently, stranding all of their money. At that point, they may be very happy that USDC is centralized and Circle may choose to recover their USDC if they can prove they owned them.

**Once small admission**: I don't beleive that users actually care about speed, but I think they look at the number and say ""faster is better"". I think they actually care about price up until the point that finality takes too long - finality on Bitcoin is a great example of taking too long.

## Retail?  

How do we get retail users to value neutrality over low fees and finality speed? **We don't**. 

Until there is a catostrophic failure on Solana which affects them personally, I don't think they'll care. The only real chance I see of that happening is if Solana has it's Tornado Cash moment, but instead of targetting Tornado Cash, the Solana Foundation is told to halt a heavily used contract, possibly a stable coin.

That raises the question: Is there a market for credible neutrality?

I think there is, and I think this is the market that Tom Lee is accelerating.

## Who wants Neutrality?  

When does the equation flip to `(low txn cost + low finality speed) < credible neutrality`? When the entity creating or facilitating the use of on-chain assets has accountability to their users! 

*That isn't the case today.* 

If you launch a product on chain and that chain shuts down, you can walk away and hide behind your ToS and deflect blame to blockchain validators. 

## Tom Lee!  

I beleive Tom Lee has realized this isn't the case for companies in the financial services industry (FSI) - they have a legal responsibility to their users and if the chain fails, they will be held responsible. They may be able to call out chain termination as a risk in the short term, but that won't be acceptable in the long run.

Not only is Tom selling FSI companies on the value of neutrality and explaining how critical it is to their business, he's showing his personal confidence in the market by publicly working with an Ethereum treasury company. This means a lot in the FSI space.

## FSI to the Rescue?  

Once the FSI onboards to Ethereum, it will start driving user adoption, though I suspect most users won't know they're using a blockchain and will instead think their using their brokerage account like they always have. At that point, users end up caring about neutrality without even realizing it. They won't pay more to transact on Ethereum, but they won't have to because their brokerage account is paying the transaction fees for them.

## Etherealize  

That's not to say that Etherealize and others like it shouldn't start marketting Ethereum and combatting the misinformation out there, but I don't see how that will influence retail users to choose Ethereum over Solana, or really any chain that's widely supported by exchanges and has a regular rotation of assets to speculate on.

The real goal for Etherealize should be to get things that people are using today onto Ethereum. That will expand what's possible on Ethereum by creating a larger network effect. The pull of that network effect will incentivize other developers to build on Ethereum despite the cost to deploy contracts, and if those assets are only on Ethereum, there won't be another chain that can compete. Users will stop caring about transaction fees once they're relying on an intermediary paying them.

## Closing  

These are my random thoughts. Please tell me where I'm wrong and how Ethereum can regain smart contract marketshare without relying on centralized businesses to bring the users.

",o-_l_-o,2025-09-18 05:49:53,39,0.85,27,ethereum,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1njrtj0/how_to_get_users_on_ethereum/,https://reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1njrtj0/how_to_get_users_on_ethereum/,True,,2025-10-10 15:07:33.360526,"How to Get Users on Ethereum There was a thread about how to get users to use Ethereum over Solana, and I thought I'd do a brain dump on my thoughts and have all of you critique my ideas and tell me I'm wrong.

##Fundamentals  

There are 4 things that users look for in a blockchain:

1. Transaction Cost - How much does it take to update blockchain state?
2. Finality Speed - How long does it take to know my state change is forever?
3. Credible Neutrality - Is there a chance that the network will be biased against me?
4. Actionable - Are there things for me to do on the chain.

## Let's take a look at some blockchains:

**Bitcoin:**  
  
- Transaction Cost: High ‚Üë  
- Finality Speed: High ‚Üë  
- Credible Neutrality: Yes ‚úì  
- Actionable: No êÑÇ 

Bitcoin was (is) slow and expensive, but it was objectivley neutral for the first 5-ish years of its life - anyone could mine it, even if it meant buying an ASIC and Bitcoin miners weren't discriminating against addresses or users. Things have changed as centralized relayers with blacklists have come into play and mining has become very centralized.

**Ethereum:**  
- Transaction Cost: Medium ‚Üí   
- Finality Speed: Medium ‚Üí  
- Credible Neutrality: Yes ‚úì  
- Actionable: Yes ‚úì  
	
Ethereum launched when people were already fed up with Bitcoin transaction costs and finality speed. Bitcoin promised being a replacement for cash, but failed to uphold that promise and refused to scale. Ethereum had, at the time, very low fees and low finality speed when compared to Bitcoin, and it was neutral because anyone was able to GPU mine and participate in the network.  
  
**Solana:**  
- Transaction Cost: Low ‚Üì  
- Finality Speed: Low (let's ignore failed txns for this discussion) ‚Üì  
- Credible Neutrality: No êÑÇ  
- Actionable: Yes ‚úì  
	
Solana offers very cheap transactions with low finality speed (again, ignoring all the failures), but has no neutrality. A PoS network without slashing means one of the following are true:

1. The network uses a cryptographic mechanism to make cheating impossible.
2. The network allows cheating.
3. The network relies on an off-chain mechanism to ensure valdiators are punished.

Solana uses option #3 via the Solana Foundation, which means they have unmatched power over the network, and they have unmatched power over all users on the network.

## What about L2s?

- Transaction Cost: Low ‚Üì
- Finality Speed: Low ‚Üì
- Credible Neutrality: Depends êÑÇ
- Actionable: Yes ‚úì
	
Looking at the equation with an L2 lens doesn't look much better than the Ethereum or Solana result - they tend to have fewer assets, less liquidity, some are neutral/some aren't, and even the ones with exit hatches don't appeal to retail because they don't plan on using it and would struggle to figure out how. L2s bring fragmentation without bringing any user-facing benefits to users. That will go away with time, but users want to make money now. Telling users that Ethereum will eventually scale and L2s will eventually be unified just makes the Ethereum space look behind while also being older than Solana.

**Side note**: I sometimes wonder if having an exit hatch makes L2s look less reliable than Solana. If L2s are so good, why are they worried about being down? (that's a rhetorical question)  
  

## What is the Primary Market?  

Since Solana has gained traction with retail users, that tells me that the current blockchain market values `(low txn cost + low finality speed) > credible neutrality`.

Back in 2013, this would have shocked me. When Ethereum launched, this would have shocked me, especially since developers seem to have the same view of the inequality.

Retail users care about one thing: How can I make as much money as possible?

This is where ""actionable"" comes in. There is nothing to do on the Bitcoin blockchain, so retail doesn't care about it. There's a lot to do on Ethereum, but the cost to develop new tokens on Ethereum makes it too expensive for fly-by-night pump and dump scams, which retail loves - it's the only way they know to make money. Solana, being very cheap and having plenty of new things to speculate on, makes it a very tempting place for gambling.

A retail user who currently transacts on Solana has zero incentive to move to Ethereum based on the fundamental difference that Ethereum is neutral (therefore safer) because the lack of neutrality won't affect their profits.

- They don't care that a small validator set controls their money.
- They don't care that the chain can halt at any time and lock them out of their money. They care during the outage, but quickly forget.
- They don't care that they have to resubmit transactions all the time because Solana doesn't have a mempool - retrying is cheap.
- They don't care that the Solana Foundation may someday stop subsidizing validators which will make running a validator a money-losing venture.
- They don't care that the chain will shut down permanently, stranding all of their money. At that point, they may be very happy that USDC is centralized and Circle may choose to recover their USDC if they can prove they owned them.

**Once small admission**: I don't beleive that users actually care about speed, but I think they look at the number and say ""faster is better"". I think they actually care about price up until the point that finality takes too long - finality on Bitcoin is a great example of taking too long.

## Retail?  

How do we get retail users to value neutrality over low fees and finality speed? **We don't**. 

Until there is a catostrophic failure on Solana which affects them personally, I don't think they'll care. The only real chance I see of that happening is if Solana has it's Tornado Cash moment, but instead of targetting Tornado Cash, the Solana Foundation is told to halt a heavily used contract, possibly a stable coin.

That raises the question: Is there a market for credible neutrality?

I think there is, and I think this is the market that Tom Lee is accelerating.

Not only is Tom selling FSI companies on the value of neutrality and explaining how critical it is to their business, he's showing his personal confidence in the market by publicly working with an Ethereum treasury company. This means a lot in the FSI space.

## FSI to the Rescue?  

Once the FSI onboards to Ethereum, it will start driving user adoption, though I suspect most users won't know they're using a blockchain and will instead think their using their brokerage account like they always have. At that point, users end up caring about neutrality without even realizing it. They won't pay more to transact on Ethereum, but they won't have to because their brokerage account is paying the transaction fees for them.

1nimgup,Using a small LLM to tune gas & block parameters on a Besu (QBFT) fork,"Hey folks,

I‚Äôve been working on Studio Blockchain for the past year, it‚Äôs a Hyperledger Besu fork running QBFT. We kept it fully EVM-compatible, but one aspect i really wanted to share with you all is something we‚Äôre doing around AI-assisted parameter tuning at the consensus layer.

The idea came from a simple pain point: on permissioned/PoA networks like QBFT, gas limits and block times are static configs. If traffic patterns change, you either over-provision (wasteful) or under-provision (latency spikes, stuck txs). Instead of setting a ‚Äúforever‚Äù number, we wanted the chain to react more like an adaptive system.

What we did was bolt on an ops agent that watches telemetry (pending txs, median gas price, block propagation delay, reorgs). The data is bucketed (1s, 10s, 1m, 5m windows) and fed to two pieces:

* a small numeric predictor (gradient-boost model) that just forecasts ‚Äúwhat will the mempool look like in 60 seconds‚Äù and ‚Äúhow will latency behave if nothing changes.‚Äù
* and a lightweight language model (we‚Äôre using LLaMA-2 7B instruct-tuned, running locally no API calls) that reads both the raw metrics and the predictor‚Äôs output, and spits back a recommendation in JSON.

The LLM is there mostly for interpretability. It doesn‚Äôt just say ‚Äúlower block time,‚Äù it gives a rationale in plain English like: ‚Äúpending gas grew +12% in the last 5 minutes, projected latency crosses 300ms, safe to shave block time from 2.0s to 1.9s since no reorgs were observed.‚Äù That‚Äôs useful for operators reading the logs.

We don‚Äôt let the model touch consensus directly. There‚Äôs a controller process that takes every suggestion and runs it through a battery of checks: static bounds (e.g. block time can never go below 1.5s), a mini-simulator that replays a few hundred blocks with the proposed params, and ensemble agreement (the numeric model has to agree it won‚Äôt spike reorg risk). Only then does it submit the change to a governance/multisig contract, which validators read on the next epoch.

So in practice the AI layer is more like an advisor with a very strict babysitter. We log every prompt, every output, and every change, so anyone can audit. If you‚Äôre curious, you can even see its decisions live here: [Studio-Scan AI Dashboard](https://studio-scan.com/ai-dashboard).

From a dev perspective, the interesting bits were:

* LLaMA-2 7B is just small enough to run inference in <500ms on commodity hardware with quantization.
* Prompts have to be extremely compact; we hand-roll a JSON schema for telemetry so the model isn‚Äôt distracted.
* The simulator is actually the most important piece we learned that without a cooling period, the model would oscillate suggestions (1.9s ‚Üí 2.0s ‚Üí 1.9s). Adding hysteresis fixed it.
* Telemetry poisoning is a real attack surface: in theory someone could spam txs to push a bad recommendation. That‚Äôs why we require agreement from the numeric predictor and ignore extreme outliers.

I‚Äôm not here to push a token, genuinely curious if anyone in the Ethereum dev/research crowd sees value in this kind of adaptive tuning. Does it sound useful, or is it just adding unnecessary complexity where hand-tuned heuristics would do?

I‚Äôve been working on Studio Blockchain for the past year, it‚Äôs a Hyperledger Besu fork running QBFT. We kept it fully EVM-compatible, but one aspect i really wanted to share with you all is something we‚Äôre doing around AI-assisted parameter tuning at the consensus layer.

The idea came from a simple pain point: on permissioned/PoA networks like QBFT, gas limits and block times are static configs. If traffic patterns change, you either over-provision (wasteful) or under-provision (latency spikes, stuck txs). Instead of setting a ‚Äúforever‚Äù number, we wanted the chain to react more like an adaptive system.

What we did was bolt on an ops agent that watches telemetry (pending txs, median gas price, block propagation delay, reorgs). The data is bucketed (1s, 10s, 1m, 5m windows) and fed to two pieces:

* a small numeric predictor (gradient-boost model) that just forecasts ‚Äúwhat will the mempool look like in 60 seconds‚Äù and ‚Äúhow will latency behave if nothing changes.‚Äù
* and a lightweight language model (we‚Äôre using LLaMA-2 7B instruct-tuned, running locally no API calls) that reads both the raw metrics and the predictor‚Äôs output, and spits back a recommendation in JSON.

The LLM is there mostly for interpretability. It doesn‚Äôt just say ‚Äúlower block time,‚Äù it gives a rationale in plain English like: ‚Äúpending gas grew +12% in the last 5 minutes, projected latency crosses 300ms, safe to shave block time from 2.0s to 1.9s since no reorgs were observed.‚Äù That‚Äôs useful for operators reading the logs.

We don‚Äôt let the model touch consensus directly. There‚Äôs a controller process that takes every suggestion and runs it through a battery of checks: static bounds (e.g. block time can never go below 1.5s), a mini-simulator that replays a few hundred blocks with the proposed params, and ensemble agreement (the numeric model has to agree it won‚Äôt spike reorg risk). Only then does it submit the change to a governance/multisig contract, which validators read on the next epoch.

So in practice the AI layer is more like an advisor with a very strict babysitter. We log every prompt, every output, and every change, so anyone can audit. If you‚Äôre curious, you can even see its decisions live here: [Studio-Scan AI Dashboard](https://studio-scan.com/ai-dashboard).

From a dev perspective, the interesting bits were:

* LLaMA-2 7B is just small enough to run inference in <500ms on commodity hardware with quantization.
* Prompts have to be extremely compact; we hand-roll a JSON schema for telemetry so the model isn‚Äôt distracted.
* The simulator is actually the most important piece we learned that without a cooling period, the model would oscillate suggestions (1.9s ‚Üí 2.0s ‚Üí 1.9s). Adding hysteresis fixed it.
* Telemetry poisoning is a real attack surface: in theory someone could spam txs to push a bad recommendation. That‚Äôs why we require agreement from the numeric predictor and ignore extreme outliers.

I‚Äôm not here to push a token, genuinely curious if anyone in the Ethereum dev/research crowd sees value in this kind of adaptive tuning. Does it sound useful, or is it just adding unnecessary complexity where hand-tuned heuristics would do? And if you‚Äôve played with AI in ops contexts, i‚Äôd love to hear where you think the real risks are (model drift, nondeterminism, etc.).

So few days ago I try to bridge some wsteth from mainnet to zksync Era with **the official bridge**.

- Transaction on mainnet: https://web3.okx.com/explorer/ethereum/tx/0x23bfeb8d5b0d553ad16019fea0da2d9097463a78597fee2f26e8e3f0cb4dae55

In the second transaction, it says the address of wsteth is 0xcafb42a2654c20cb3739f04243e925aa47302bec, but the wsteth address accepted on AAVE or uniswap is 0x703b52F2b28fEbcB60E1372858AF5b18849FE867 

Of course I panic and think I finally got scammed. I can still bridge it back to mainnet with the official bridge to mainnet (but unofficial bridge doesn't have this token!). Luckily it's the normal mainnet wsteth again, so I didn't lose any fund besides the gas fee. But the bridging takes 12+ hours, not to mention how much it worries me that I may lose all that fund. 

I than follow this doc on Lido to bridge and it success : https://help.lido.fi/en/articles/8687902-bridging-to-zksync. It still use the official bridge under the hood, but the frontend is a different one, I guess they call the contract differently

1nfkjcw,"Gig economy idea, needs work but the bones are there","Okay round 2.
‚ÄãThe Drift: A New Economic Model for the Gig Economy

‚ÄãThe gig economy was once hailed as the future of work, offering freedom and flexibility. However, it has evolved into a system where independent professionals face a series of systemic struggles that limit their potential and undermine their financial stability. The Drift is a decentralized web3 platform designed to address these core issues and empower a new generation of creators.

‚ÄãThe Problem with the Current Gig Economy
‚ÄãThe modern gig economy, facilitated by centralized corporate platforms, suffers from five critical flaws:

‚ÄãExploitative Corporate Cuts: Corporations take a disproportionately large percentage of a worker‚Äôs earnings. Platforms are known to take commissions ranging from 10% to over 20%, which significantly reduces a professional‚Äôs take-home pay and stifles their ability to build wealth.

‚ÄãInconsistent and Delayed Payouts: Freelancers face chronic issues with late or delayed payments. Reports show that a significant majority of freelancers have experienced late invoice payments, with many waiting days or even weeks to get paid for their work. This creates financial instability and hardship for gig workers.

‚ÄãLack of True Ownership: Gig workers do not own their professional identities, portfolios, or work. The content they create is often subject to ambiguous work-for-hire clauses, and their entire online presence can be removed or censored at the discretion of a single platform.

‚ÄãCensorship and De-platforming: Centralized platforms act as a single point of control, giving them the power to arbitrarily de-platform a user or remove their content. This threat looms over creators, jeopardizing their reputation and ability to earn an income.

‚ÄãDifficulty Securing Work: The gig market is highly fragmented and often opaque. Professionals struggle to get paid what they are worth and find it difficult to secure consistent, high-value work and advertising gigs, as they must compete within the confines of a platform‚Äôs specific ecosystem.

‚ÄãThe Solution: 

The Drift's Decentralized Model:

‚ÄãThe Drift is built on a decentralized, transparent, and user-governed framework that tackles these problems head-on. Our platform is designed to:

‚ÄãEliminate Corporate Middlemen: By removing the central authority, The Drift is able to significantly reduce transaction costs, allowing creators to earn what they are truly worth. A small, transparent protocol fee is used to maintain the system, not to generate corporate profit.

‚ÄãGuarantee Secure and Timely Payouts: Smart contracts ensure that payments are released instantly and securely upon the completion of a gig, eliminating the issue of late or inconsistent payments. Funds are held in escrow on the blockchain, providing trust and transparency for both the creator and the client.

‚ÄãEmpower User Governance: The platform is designed to be a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO). The community of users and creators will have a direct say in key decisions and future developments, ensuring the platform always operates in their best interest.

‚ÄãThe Role of the Resonance Token:

‚ÄãThe Resonance token is not an unnecessary addition; it is the fundamental utility and governance layer of The Drift's ecosystem. It solves the critical challenge of a global, frictionless payment system.

‚ÄãUniversal Medium of Exchange: The token acts as a universal currency for all transactions on the platform, bypassing the complexities, fees, and delays of international fiat-to-fiat conversions. It allows a creator in one country to seamlessly and instantly get paid by a client in another.

‚ÄãFee Structure: The Resonance token is used to pay the protocol fees for transactions and services on the platform. This fee goes back into the system to reward users and maintain the network, rather than into a corporate treasury.

‚ÄãGovernance: Holding Resonance tokens gives users the power to vote on proposals, including platform upgrades, fee changes, and other key decisions. This fulfills our mission of building a system ""run by a government of the people.""

‚ÄãThe Creator Payout Model: 

Aligned Incentives:
‚ÄãThis model was designed with one primary goal in mind: to build unwavering trust from a highly skeptical community. We understand that in the current web3 landscape, the immediate assumption about any new token is that it's a vehicle for the creators to get rich quickly. This model is a direct rebuttal to that assumption.

‚ÄãThe Thinking Behind the Payout Model:

‚ÄãThis model is a testament to our commitment to the platform's vision. It signals that this is not a short-term venture, but a labor of necessity. The creator's reward is directly tied to building something that is needed, not something that is speculative. This is a testament to our commitment to building a sustainable ecosystem for creators, not a speculative asset for ourselves.

‚ÄãThe Creator's Payout:

‚ÄãThe creator of the platform is not a pre-allocated token holder. Instead, their incentives are fully aligned with the platform‚Äôs long-term health and success. A small percentage of the total economic activity that takes place on the platform will be automatically disbursed to the creator's wallet.

‚ÄãNo Pre-Allocation: 

The creator does not possess a large, unearned supply of the Resonance token. They cannot simply ""dump"" a token on the market.

‚ÄãPayouts via Smart Contract: 

The commission is hard-coded into the platform's smart contract. This means the payout mechanism is public, transparent, and auditable by anyone in the community.

‚ÄãRewarding Value, Not Creation: 
The creator only gets paid when the platform is actively being used and generating value for its users. This ensures the creator is incentivized to continuously maintain, improve, and promote the platform, as their compensation is directly tied to its ongoing economic activity.

‚ÄãTechnical Architecture:

‚ÄãThe core functionality of The Drift is built on a decentralized technical stack, ensuring transparency, security, and immutability. Unlike a centralized platform with a private database, our architecture is open and auditable by anyone.

‚ÄãThe Blockchain Backbone:

‚ÄãThe Drift will operate on a public blockchain that supports robust smart contract functionality, such as Ethereum. To ensure efficiency and low transaction costs for users, it will be deployed on a Layer-2 scaling solution. This provides the security and decentralization of the main blockchain while offering the speed and affordability necessary for a high-volume platform.

‚ÄãSmart Contracts: 

The Rules of the Game:

‚ÄãThe core business logic of the platform is governed by a series of smart contracts. These are self-executing programs that run on the blockchain. They ensure that all transactions and agreements are tamper-proof and transparent. Key smart contracts will include:

‚ÄãEscrow Contract: 

Funds for a gig are held securely in a smart contract. Once both parties verify that the work is complete, the contract automatically releases the payment to the creator and sends a small protocol fee to the system. This eliminates the risk of non-payment.

‚ÄãPayment Contract: 

This handles all fund transfers, including payouts to creators, client payments, and the distribution of fees.

‚ÄãGovernance Contract: 

This contract manages the voting process, allowing Resonance token holders to vote on proposals and directly influence the platform's future.
‚ÄãCensorship and True Ownership via Decentralized Governance.

‚ÄãCentralized gig platforms maintain total control over a user's presence, from their profile to their portfolio. This creates a risk of arbitrary censorship and de-platforming, where a worker can lose their entire professional identity due to a single platform's policy or decision. The content you create, your reputation, and your ability to earn an income are all held hostage by a single corporate entity.

‚ÄãThe Drift's Decentralized Solution:

‚ÄãThe Drift tackles this fundamental flaw by empowering creators with true ownership and governance.

‚ÄãYou Own Your Identity with IPFS:

 All user profiles, portfolios, and content are stored on the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS). This peer-to-peer network is designed to store and share data in a distributed way, making it resilient to censorship. By hosting your profile on IPFS, your professional identity and work are tied to a cryptographic hash, giving you a permanent and portable link that no one can delete.

‚ÄãYou Govern the Platform with the DAO: 

The issue of censorship isn't just about where your data is stored; it's about who gets to make the rules. The Drift's Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) ensures that no single entity can arbitrarily de-platform a creator. Any decisions regarding content, user policies, or platform rules are made by the community of token holders through a transparent on-chain voting process. This distributes power, making it virtually impossible for any one person or small group to enforce censorship.

‚ÄãDecentralized Dispute Resolution:

‚ÄãDisputes over contracts and payments are a common problem in the gig economy. In centralized platforms, a corporate support team acts as the final arbiter, and their decisions can be arbitrary and biased. The Drift replaces this with a decentralized, community-driven resolution system.

‚ÄãHow the DAO Handles Disputes:

‚ÄãWhen a dispute arises between a client and a creator‚Äîfor example, a disagreement over whether the work was completed to the required standard‚Äîthe issue is submitted to the DAO.

‚ÄãFormal Submission: 

The dispute is formally submitted on-chain, and the funds held in the smart contract escrow are temporarily locked.

‚ÄãCommunity Arbitration: 

The DAO's members (Resonance token holders) act as a decentralized jury. They review the evidence submitted by both parties. This could include project details, communications, and the final work product, all of which are stored on a decentralized network.

‚ÄãVoting and Execution: 

Token holders vote to decide the outcome. To incentivize fair and honest voting, the system may require token holders to stake a small amount of Resonance. Those who vote with the consensus are rewarded, while those who vote against it may lose their stake.

‚ÄãAutomated Resolution: 

Once a consensus is reached, the smart contract automatically executes the decision. It will either release the funds to the creator, refund them to the client, or split them as the community has decided.
‚ÄãThis system ensures that disputes are handled transparently and fairly by the community, not by a single, potentially biased corporate entity.

‚ÄãGamification and Community Engagement:

‚ÄãThe Drift is more than just a platform; it's an ecosystem designed to foster a vibrant and engaged community. We believe that by integrating game-like elements, we can create a more rewarding and enjoyable experience for all participants, from new creators to seasoned professionals.

‚ÄãHow Gamification Works:

‚ÄãReputation System: Creators will earn reputation points and badges for completing projects, receiving positive feedback, and participating in the DAO's governance. This verifiable on-chain reputation will serve as a powerful signal of a creator's skill and reliability.

‚ÄãLeaderboards and Rewards: The platform will feature transparent leaderboards that showcase top creators based on reputation, completed projects, or contributions to the community. These top performers can be rewarded with special privileges or airdrops of the Resonance token from a community-managed treasury.

‚ÄãQuests and Bounties: The platform can use smart contracts to create ""quests"" or ""bounties"" for specific tasks that need to be completed for the community, such as building a new feature or creating marketing content. This incentivizes collaboration and allows community members to directly contribute to the platform's growth.
‚ÄãGamification transforms a transactional experience into a collaborative journey. It encourages a long-term commitment to the platform and rewards participants for adding value to the entire ecosystem, creating a positive feedback loop that benefits everyone involved.

‚ÄãDrifter NFTs: 

Identity, Governance, and Ecosystem Funding:

‚ÄãThe Drifter NFTs are a core part of the platform's economics and governance, serving as more than just a collectible. They function as the unique, non-fungible backbone of a creator's identity, a key to governance, and a mechanism for funding the ecosystem's growth.

‚Äã1. Identity, Reputation, and Governance

‚ÄãWhile the Resonance token is used for payments and voting, the Drifter NFTs serve as the unique, non-fungible backbone of a creator's identity and governance rights. These are not just collectibles; they are a direct representation of a creator's participation and standing in the community.
‚ÄãProof of Participation: A Drifter NFT is your digital identity on the platform, a unique token that proves you are a contributing member of the ecosystem. This token can also serve as a key to access certain features or community channels.

‚ÄãTiered Governance: 

While the Resonance token gives you a vote, the Drifter NFTs can introduce a tiered governance model. For instance, a basic NFT might give you standard voting rights, but an NFT earned for a high volume of successful gigs might grant you a higher level of voting power or the ability to submit proposals to the DAO.

‚ÄãReputation on the Blockchain: 

The NFT can evolve over time to reflect a creator's journey. It can accumulate metadata to show your reputation score, a number of completed jobs, or a track record of fair voting in disputes. This creates a powerful, verifiable resume that is tied directly to your NFT and cannot be altered.

‚Äã2. The NFT Launch and Funding

‚ÄãThe initial distribution of Drifter NFTs will be conducted through a fair and transparent minting event. This event serves not as a vehicle for the creators' personal gain, but as the initial capital raise to build and sustain the entire ecosystem. The funds from the minting event will be automatically and transparently allocated to the following key areas:

‚ÄãDevelopment & Audits (40%): A significant portion of the funds will be allocated to a multi-signature wallet to finance ongoing development, smart contract audits, and security measures. This ensures that the platform is not only built, but remains secure and reliable for the community.

‚ÄãCommunity Treasury (30%): A large portion will be funneled directly into a DAO-controlled treasury. These funds will be used for community-led initiatives, creator grants, and future projects that are proposed and voted on by the token holders.

‚ÄãMarketing & Growth (15%): These funds are essential for expanding the platform's reach, onboarding new creators and clients, and building partnerships within the broader web3 space.

‚ÄãLiquidity & Reserves (15%): This portion will be used to provide initial liquidity for the Resonance token on decentralized exchanges (DEXs), ensuring a healthy market and smooth trading. A reserve will also be held for unexpected costs or emergency situations.

‚Äã3. The Staking Mechanism:

‚ÄãOwning a Drifter NFT is not a passive investment; it is an active commitment to the platform. By staking their Drifter NFT, holders can participate in two key systems:
‚ÄãDispute Resolution: As we discussed, a staked NFT can be used to vote on contract disputes. This mechanism provides a powerful incentive for fair and honest participation in the DAO's arbitration process.

‚ÄãEarning Rewards: Staking a Drifter NFT can also generate rewards in the form of Resonance tokens. This encourages long-term holding and participation in the ecosystem, ensuring that the most committed community members are rewarded for their dedication.

‚ÄãRoadmap and Future Development:

‚ÄãBuilding a decentralized platform requires a phased approach that prioritizes security, functionality, and community growth. The following roadmap outlines our plan for the launch and long-term development of The Drift, with each phase guided by the community through the DAO.

‚ÄãPhase 1: 

Foundation & Launch: This phase focuses on establishing a secure and stable foundation for the platform.
‚ÄãSmart Contract Audits: The core smart contracts for payments, escrow, and governance will undergo a comprehensive audit by a reputable third-party firm. This is non-negotiable and ensures the security of user funds.

‚ÄãBeta Launch: An initial version of the platform will be released to a small group of beta testers. This will allow us to gather feedback and test the platform under real-world conditions.

‚ÄãMainnet Launch: Following a successful beta, The Drift will be launched on the selected Layer-2 solution. The platform will be fully functional, allowing creators to onboard and start taking on gigs.

‚ÄãPhase 2: 

Growth & Ecosystem Expansion:

‚ÄãOnce the platform is live and stable, the focus will shift to community and feature development.

‚ÄãUser Onboarding: A concerted effort will be made to onboard a wider range of creators and clients to the platform.

‚ÄãEnhanced Features: New functionalities will be added based on community feedback, such as more complex contract types, reputation systems, and advanced search filters.

‚ÄãStrategic Partnerships: We will seek partnerships with companies and other decentralized projects to increase the platform's visibility and utility.
‚ÄãPhase 3: Decentralization & DAO Handover
‚ÄãThe final and most critical phase of the roadmap.

‚ÄãFull Governance Handover: The core team will hand over all governance authority to the DAO. This means that all future decisions regarding the platform's direction, protocol upgrades, and treasury management will be decided solely by the token holders through on-chain voting.

‚ÄãCommunity-Led Development: Development will transition to a community-led model. Grant programs will be established to incentivize contributors to propose and build new features for the platform.

‚ÄãThis roadmap is a living document, and its future direction will be entirely in the hands of the community.

‚ÄãConclusion:

‚ÄãThe current gig economy is a fragmented and flawed system that works against the very creators it claims to empower. Centralized platforms and outdated payment models lead to low wages, delayed payments, a lack of ownership, and the constant threat of censorship.

‚ÄãThe Drift is a direct and necessary response to these challenges. We have designed a platform based on the core principles of decentralization, powered by a purpose-built token and governed by a community of its own users. Our model is built for transparency, a sustainable ecosystem, and true ownership of your work.

‚ÄãWe are not just building another platform; we are building a new economic foundation for creators‚Äîa place where you own your identity, are paid what you're worth, and have a direct say in the future of the system you help to build.

‚ÄãCensorship and True Ownership via Decentralized Governance.

‚ÄãCentralized gig platforms maintain total control over a user's presence, from their profile to their portfolio. This creates a risk of arbitrary censorship and de-platforming, where a worker can lose their entire professional identity due to a single platform's policy or decision. The content you create, your reputation, and your ability to earn an income are all held hostage by a single corporate entity.

‚ÄãThe Drift's Decentralized Solution:

‚ÄãThe Drift tackles this fundamental flaw by empowering creators with true ownership and governance.

‚ÄãYou Own Your Identity with IPFS:

 All user profiles, portfolios, and content are stored on the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS). This peer-to-peer network is designed to store and share data in a distributed way, making it resilient to censorship. By hosting your profile on IPFS, your professional identity and work are tied to a cryptographic hash, giving you a permanent and portable link that no one can delete.

‚ÄãYou Govern the Platform with the DAO: 

The issue of censorship isn't just about where your data is stored; it's about who gets to make the rules. The Drift's Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) ensures that no single entity can arbitrarily de-platform a creator. Any decisions regarding content, user policies, or platform rules are made by the community of token holders through a transparent on-chain voting process. This distributes power, making it virtually impossible for any one person or small group to enforce censorship.

‚ÄãDecentralized Dispute Resolution:

‚ÄãDisputes over contracts and payments are a common problem in the gig economy. In centralized platforms, a corporate support team acts as the final arbiter, and their decisions can be arbitrary and biased. The Drift replaces this with a decentralized, community-driven resolution system.

‚ÄãHow the DAO Handles Disputes:

‚ÄãWhen a dispute arises between a client and a creator‚Äîfor example, a disagreement over whether the work was completed to the required standard‚Äîthe issue is submitted to the DAO.

‚ÄãFormal Submission: 

The dispute is formally submitted on-chain, and the funds held in the smart contract escrow are temporarily locked.

‚ÄãCommunity Arbitration: 

The DAO's members (Resonance token holders) act as a decentralized jury. They review the evidence submitted by both parties. This could include project details, communications, and the final work product, all of which are stored on a decentralized network.

‚ÄãVoting and Execution: 

Token holders vote to decide the outcome. To incentivize fair and honest voting, the system may require token holders to stake a small amount of Resonance. Those who vote with the consensus are rewarded, while those who vote against it may lose their stake.

‚ÄãAutomated Resolution: 

Once a consensus is reached, the smart contract automatically executes the decision. It will either release the funds to the creator, refund them to the client, or split them as the community has decided.
‚ÄãThis system ensures that disputes are handled transparently and fairly by the community, not by a single, potentially biased corporate entity.

‚ÄãGamification and Community Engagement:

‚ÄãThe Drift is more than just a platform; it's an ecosystem designed to foster a vibrant and engaged community. We believe that by integrating game-like elements, we can create a more rewarding and enjoyable experience for all participants, from new creators to seasoned professionals.

‚ÄãHow Gamification Works:

‚ÄãReputation System: Creators will earn reputation points and badges for completing projects, receiving positive feedback, and participating in the DAO's governance. This verifiable on-chain reputation will serve as a powerful signal of a creator's skill and reliability.

‚ÄãLeaderboards and Rewards: The platform will feature transparent leaderboards that showcase top creators based on reputation, completed projects, or contributions to the community. These top performers can be rewarded with special privileges or airdrops of the Resonance token from a community-managed treasury.

‚ÄãQuests and Bounties: The platform can use smart contracts to create ""quests"" or ""bounties"" for specific tasks that need to be completed for the community, such as building a new feature or creating marketing content. This incentivizes collaboration and allows community members to directly contribute to the platform's growth.
‚ÄãGamification transforms a transactional experience into a collaborative journey. It encourages a long-term commitment to the platform and rewards participants for adding value to the entire ecosystem, creating a positive feedback loop that benefits everyone involved.

‚ÄãDrifter NFTs: 

Identity, Governance, and Ecosystem Funding:

‚ÄãThe Drifter NFTs are a core part of the platform's economics and governance, serving as more than just a collectible. They function as the unique, non-fungible backbone of a creator's identity, a key to governance, and a mechanism for funding the ecosystem's growth.

‚Äã1. Identity, Reputation, and Governance

‚ÄãWhile the Resonance token is used for payments and voting, the Drifter NFTs serve as the unique, non-fungible backbone of a creator's identity and governance rights. These are not just collectibles; they are a direct representation of a creator's participation and standing in the community.
‚ÄãProof of Participation: A Drifter NFT is your digital identity on the platform, a unique token that proves you are a contributing member of the ecosystem. This token can also serve as a key to access certain features or community channels.

‚ÄãTiered Governance: 

While the Resonance token gives you a vote, the Drifter NFTs can introduce a tiered governance model. For instance, a basic NFT might give you standard voting rights, but an NFT earned for a high volume of successful gigs might grant you a higher level of voting power or the ability to submit proposals to the DAO.

‚ÄãReputation on the Blockchain: 

The NFT can evolve over time to reflect a creator's journey. It can accumulate metadata to show your reputation score, a number of completed jobs, or a track record of fair voting in disputes. This creates a powerful, verifiable resume that is tied directly to your NFT and cannot be altered.

‚Äã2. The NFT Launch and Funding

‚ÄãThe initial distribution of Drifter NFTs will be conducted through a fair and transparent minting event. This event serves not as a vehicle for the creators' personal gain, but as the initial capital raise to build and sustain the entire ecosystem. The funds from the minting event will be automatically and transparently allocated to the following key areas:

‚ÄãDevelopment & Audits (40%): A significant portion of the funds will be allocated to a multi-signature wallet to finance ongoing development, smart contract audits, and security measures. This ensures that the platform is not only built, but remains secure and reliable for the community.

‚ÄãCommunity Treasury (30%): A large portion will be funneled directly into a DAO-controlled treasury. These funds will be used for community-led initiatives, creator grants, and future projects that are proposed and voted on by the token holders.

‚ÄãMarketing & Growth (15%): These funds are essential for expanding the platform's reach, onboarding new creators and clients, and building partnerships within the broader web3 space.

‚ÄãLiquidity & Reserves (15%): This portion will be used to provide initial liquidity for the Resonance token on decentralized exchanges (DEXs), ensuring a healthy market and smooth trading. A reserve will also be held for unexpected costs or emergency situations.

‚Äã3. The Staking Mechanism:

‚ÄãOwning a Drifter NFT is not a passive investment; it is an active commitment to the platform. By staking their Drifter NFT, holders can participate in two key systems:
‚ÄãDispute Resolution: As we discussed, a staked NFT can be used to vote on contract disputes. This mechanism provides a powerful incentive for fair and honest participation in the DAO's arbitration process.

‚ÄãEarning Rewards: Staking a Drifter NFT can also generate rewards in the form of Resonance tokens. This encourages long-term holding and participation in the ecosystem, ensuring that the most committed community members are rewarded for their dedication.

‚ÄãRoadmap and Future Development:

‚ÄãBuilding a decentralized platform requires a phased approach that prioritizes security, functionality, and community growth. The following roadmap outlines our plan for the launch and long-term development of The Drift, with each phase guided by the community through the DAO.

‚ÄãPhase 1: 

Foundation & Launch: This phase focuses on establishing a secure and stable foundation for the platform.
‚ÄãSmart Contract Audits: The core smart contracts for payments, escrow, and governance will undergo a comprehensive audit by a reputable third-party firm. This is non-negotiable and ensures the security of user funds.

‚ÄãBeta Launch: An initial version of the platform will be released to a small group of beta testers. This will allow us to gather feedback and test the platform under real-world conditions.

‚ÄãMainnet Launch: Following a successful beta, The Drift will be launched on the selected Layer-2 solution. The platform will be fully functional, allowing creators to onboard and start taking on gigs.

‚ÄãPhase 2: 

Growth & Ecosystem Expansion:

‚ÄãOnce the platform is live and stable, the focus will shift to community and feature development.

‚ÄãUser Onboarding: A concerted effort will be made to onboard a wider range of creators and clients to the platform.

‚ÄãEnhanced Features: New functionalities will be added based on community feedback, such as more complex contract types, reputation systems, and advanced search filters.

‚ÄãStrategic Partnerships: We will seek partnerships with companies and other decentralized projects to increase the platform's visibility and utility.
‚ÄãPhase 3: Decentralization & DAO Handover
‚ÄãThe final and most critical phase of the roadmap.

‚ÄãFull Governance Handover: The core team will hand over all governance authority to the DAO. This means that all future decisions regarding the platform's direction, protocol upgrades, and treasury management will be decided solely by the token holders through on-chain voting.

‚ÄãCommunity-Led Development: Development will transition to a community-led model. Grant programs will be established to incentivize contributors to propose and build new features for the platform.

‚ÄãThis roadmap is a living document, and its future direction will be entirely in the hands of the community.

‚ÄãConclusion:

‚ÄãThe current gig economy is a fragmented and flawed system that works against the very creators it claims to empower. Centralized platforms and outdated payment models lead to low wages, delayed payments, a lack of ownership, and the constant threat of censorship.

‚ÄãThe Drift is a direct and necessary response to these challenges. We have designed a platform based on the core principles of decentralization, powered by a purpose-built token and governed by a community of its own users. Our model is built for transparency, a sustainable ecosystem, and true ownership of your work.

‚ÄãWe are not just building another platform; we are building a new economic foundation for creators‚Äîa place where you own your identity, are paid what you're worth, and have a direct say in the future of the system you help to build.

1o25tu4,The Bitcoin 4-Year Cycle is actually Dead. Here's Why.,"Tl;dr: the classic 4-year Bitcoin cycle might be over. It‚Äôs not about halvings anymore.. it‚Äôs about liquidity. When the Fed cuts rates and China eases, money flows and Bitcoin rises. The next cycle isn‚Äôt on a timer, it‚Äôs tied to global policy.

So Arthur Hayes, BitMEX‚Äôs cofounder, says the four year Bitcoin cycle that everyone loves to reference might finally be over. And honestly, it makes sense when you look at what‚Äôs actually driving markets right now.

Most people still think Bitcoin‚Äôs price cycles revolve around halvings, those moments when mining rewards get cut in half every four years. Hayes doesn‚Äôt buy it. He says Bitcoin‚Äôs movements are tied to one thing above everything else: global liquidity, especially from the United States and China.

When you zoom out, his logic checks out. Bitcoin‚Äôs early rallies all lined up with periods of easy money, the Fed‚Äôs quantitative easing, China‚Äôs massive credit growth, and crashes came right after both started tightening. The 2020 to 2021 bull run was fueled by record stimulus and near zero rates. The 2022 bear market was triggered by the Fed‚Äôs fastest rate hikes in decades.

But right now things are shifting again. The Fed already cut rates in September 2025, its first move this cycle, even with inflation still sitting above target. On top of that, the reverse repo balances that had soaked up 2.5 trillion dollars in liquidity since 2022 are basically drained, putting cash right back into markets.

Meanwhile, China is no longer acting as a drag. The People‚Äôs Bank of China has been easing rates and reserve requirements to fight off deflation. That combination, looser US policy and mild Chinese stimulus, is a recipe for more liquidity and cheaper money.

Hayes summed it up pretty simply: ‚ÄúMoney shall be cheaper and more plentiful. Therefore, Bitcoin continues to rise.‚Äù It‚Äôs not magic or halving cycles anymore, it‚Äôs macro.

Some analysts still see patterns that look like the old four year rhythm, but it‚Äôs probably just coincidence. The underlying driver has changed. Bitcoin now trades like a liquidity sensitive global asset, not a retail hype machine following a calendar.

This shift also changes how traders need to think about timing and taxes. When Bitcoin moved on predictable four year cycles, tax planning was straightforward - you could time long term capital gains around halvings. Now that moves are tied to unpredictable central bank decisions, tracking cost basis across multiple entries and exits becomes more critical. Platforms like awaken.tax are seeing this reflected in usage patterns as traders make more frequent portfolio adjustments based on policy signals rather than waiting for halving milestones.

If Washington or Beijing suddenly tightened again, Bitcoin would correct hard, halving or not. So instead of obsessing over block rewards and countdown clocks, it might be smarter to watch central bank balance sheets and money supply charts.

The new Bitcoin cycle isn‚Äôt four years anymore. It‚Äôs whenever the money printers turn on or off.",hodorrny,2025-10-09 20:23:42,114,0.76,116,cryptomarkets,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1o25tu4/the_bitcoin_4year_cycle_is_actually_dead_heres_why/,https://reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1o25tu4/the_bitcoin_4year_cycle_is_actually_dead_heres_why/,True,ANALYSIS,2025-10-10 15:07:36.898388,"The Bitcoin 4-Year Cycle is actually Dead.

1o2d54w,Anyone hear of ZCASH?

This resurgence is also fueled by factors like institutional adoption, high-profile endorsements, and a renewed interest in the founding principles of cryptocurrency.

1o1h9y2,Ethereum: Where are we on the risk metric?,"ETH broke its ATH a few weeks ago. As I noted in earlier posts, the ETH risk metric hasn‚Äôt spent sustained time in the heated zone yet (80-100). We only saw a brief push into the low 60s.

Right now: risk = 55 : \~$4,469. ETH has been touching this band since Feb 2024 roughly 1.7 years.

History: parabolic runs that began from risk \~50:

* Feb 2016 (\~$4.35): ran until Jan 2018, risk \~88, price $1.4K ( \~2 year run).
* Jun 2020 (\~$311), special case, post COVID liquidity: hit risk 95 in Jun 2021 ($4K), ultimate top Nov 2021 at risk 80 ($4,732, 1.5 year run).

This cycle: ETH first reached risk 50 in Feb 2024. It‚Äôs been \~1.7 years with no sustained 80-100 yet. Yet, ETH doesn‚Äôt have as many full cycles as BTC, so I anchor to Bitcoin history (since 2013, each BTC cycle has tended to extend by \~0.5 year). As the base asset, BTC sets the tempo, I expect ETH to rhyme with that.

Levels to watch:

* If ETH clears and holds above risk 60, my model points next to the 70s risk band: $5,960 on the Dynamic Risk Range.
* If ETH loses the 50 band, a retest of the 40s risk band is likely: $3,377 before any durable breakout.

1o1lbjg,"Fed Meeting Minutes Coming Thursday, What Rate Cut Signals Mean for Crypto Markets","The Fed is gearing up to release its meeting minutes Thursday, and crypto markets are watching closely for clues about future policy direction.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell recently emphasized that ‚Äúconsiderable uncertainty remains‚Äù as the central bank balances risks between cooling inflation and preserving a strong labor market. This makes rate decisions more nuanced than usual.

Bitcoin sits near $122,400 with the broader crypto market capitalization hovering around $2.44 trillion. The past week saw about a 4.3% gain, indicating traders may already be positioning ahead of the Fed‚Äôs signals.

The link between interest rates and crypto is well established. Lower rates tend to make borrowing cheaper and push capital into assets with upside potential, including digital assets. Conversely, high rates often divert money toward yield-bearing instruments.

If the minutes hint at upcoming cuts, crypto could benefit from increased liquidity and positive sentiment. But if officials remain divided or cautious, markets may react with volatility as participants adjust expectations.

Altcoins often mirror Bitcoin‚Äôs macro moves, sometimes with exaggerated swings, so their direction will likely follow. One on-chain signal to watch is transaction volume. If rate cuts look more likely, increased network activity often follows in past cycles.

The 4.3% weekly gain suggests bullish bias is creeping in, but markets are still vulnerable until the minutes confirm the direction.

Either way, increased volatility means more trades, and more taxable events,  something most traders forget until tax season. Platforms like Awaken. tax automatically track transactions and realized gains across exchanges and wallets, so you‚Äôre not scrambling through spreadsheets later.

At the end of the day, cuts don‚Äôt operate in a vacuum. If easing comes amid economic weakening, that could dampen the upside.

1o1vmmo,What If Satoshi Moves His 100 Billion Bitcoin? what domino effect will it create?,"Bitcoin‚Äôs creator Satoshi Nakamoto is estimated to own between 1.1 and 1.5 million BTC mined between 2009 and 2010. At current prices that stash would be worth roughly 100 to 120 billion dollars. None of those coins have ever been moved and the wallets associated with Satoshi have remained untouched since December 2010.

Nobody knows whether Satoshi lost access deliberately chose never to spend or is even still alive.

If any of those early coins suddenly moved markets would almost certainly react sharply. Many investors would interpret it as a loss of confidence by Bitcoin‚Äôs creator triggering panic selling similar to reactions seen during events like Mt Gox creditor distributions or major exchange collapses.

The real impact though would be psychological. Institutions and funds hold Bitcoin partly because it is viewed as decentralized and stable with no insider activity. A sudden movement of Satoshi‚Äôs holdings could shake that perception and reduce institutional trust in the asset.

There is also a possible positive scenario. If Satoshi moved coins gradually or donated part of the holdings to research open source development or global causes it could actually boost Bitcoin‚Äôs legitimacy showing that the creator remains aligned with Bitcoin‚Äôs ethos.

Any movement would draw immediate regulatory attention. Agencies worldwide would likely investigate the source and use the event to justify tighter oversight of crypto markets.

The most dramatic outcome would be Satoshi revealing their identity while moving the coins which would redefine Bitcoin‚Äôs narrative and possibly its governance debates.

there was more threads but lots of them got removed by mods and I got banned from some subs as well, that's how much people were against this back then.

I'm seeing a lot of posts lately from people asking about buying Bitcoin on credit. In 2015 when I just turned 18 I bought 85 Bitcoin @ around 235 each with a $20k student line of credit. Instead of going to college I used that money to buy Bitcoin and when i talked about it back then everyone said I was an idiot for doing it. But it worked out great because bitcoin was still a nascent technology at the time. Along with holding my initial position I doubled down many times and greatly grew my stack.

The problem with buying Bitcoin on credit these days is that the free market alone no longer really determines the price of btc and you are leaving yourself open to being wiped out by a financial entities manipulation. There are lots of government, corporate and central bank games being played with Bitcoin today. In the early bitcoin days things happened organically, it was simple supply and demand that caused the btc price to go up and down. There was also the fact it was a new technology and even if there wasn't demand for btc at some points back then you could still say you believe in the tech and if the tech was solid it would pay off down the line and bitcoin will go mainstream resulting in the btc price exploding.

Well that dream was realized and Bitcoin went mainstream. But the fact that bitcoin is mainstream now also means it has achieved deeper integration with financial institutions and the government. These entities are now manipulating the price of bitcoin like they did with traditional assets. Bitcoin can now have a manufactured downtrend in price caused by these financial institutions. Let's say you buy bitcoin on credit one day, you could be wiped out and lose everything not because of organic sell pressure but because of government/tradfi manipulation pushing the price down. This wasn't a problem back then but it is now. They have enough money to decide when btc pumps and when it dumps because they literally print fiat and unfortunately many in the space today only care about btc going up so they can dump it for fiat. This plays directly into the hands of the financial institutions and central banks. These are the entities that cause recessions, maybe they create another one once you buy on credit and you get wiped out that way. So these days it could be better to buy btc with your own money instead of on credit, so even if there is a downtrend you can still keep your btc and ride it to $1m per coin instead of having to sell it in a downtrend to pay off your credit resulting in you missing gains.

Also 10 years ago when Bitcoin was $200 each the marketcap was 3 billion, today the Bitcoin marketcap is 2.4 trillion. Almost 1000x bigger. Orders of magnitude of more money needs to be put into bitcoin today to move it the exact same percentage as back then. in 2015 if btc marketcap went up another 3 billion that would double the price. Today for the price to double another 2.4 Trillion needs to be added to the marketcap. Of course literally $2.4 T dollars don't need to be injected but you get what I'm saying, we're on a bigger scale now and it takes much more to move the price. We aren't seeing frequent 40% daily pumps and weekly 10x increase in price anymore for a reason.

For clarification I still think btc is going to $1m per bitcoin, so of course if you time your credit buys properly you'll come out ahead but do you really think you can time it? The risk of getting caught in a downturn is really big and that could wipe you out.

And sorry if this seemed like a doomer post, I don't want this to be taken as a bearish post because I'm still super bullish on Bitcoin and always have been. I just think the central banks are now greatly manipulating bitcoin and wiping people out so they can get even more of peoples bitcoin and control the supply as much as possible. This is all a big plan by them to manipulate Bitcoin like they do everything else, they don't want people owning btc they want it all for themselves. A lot of these ETFs, btc treasuries and other recent tradfi integrations of bitcoin will be used by the government to control the supply of Bitcoin.

And even though I say the risk of buying credit on bitcoin is huge today and I wouldn't recommend it some part of me still wants to beat this government and tradfi trash that is trying to corrupt Bitcoin lol. I think I can beat them at their own game so I still have some credit btc positions open. I'm happy I was able to use the tradfi system against them back then and use their credit to purchase real currency btc.

There was also the fact it was a new technology and even if there wasn't demand for btc at some points back then you could still say you believe in the tech and if the tech was solid it would pay off down the line and bitcoin will go mainstream resulting in the btc price exploding.

Well that dream was realized and Bitcoin went mainstream. But the fact that bitcoin is mainstream now also means it has achieved deeper integration with financial institutions and the government. These entities are now manipulating the price of bitcoin like they did with traditional assets. Bitcoin can now have a manufactured downtrend in price caused by these financial institutions. Let's say you buy bitcoin on credit one day, you could be wiped out and lose everything not because of organic sell pressure but because of government/tradfi manipulation pushing the price down. This wasn't a problem back then but it is now. They have enough money to decide when btc pumps and when it dumps because they literally print fiat and unfortunately many in the space today only care about btc going up so they can dump it for fiat. This plays directly into the hands of the financial institutions and central banks. These are the entities that cause recessions, maybe they create another one once you buy on credit and you get wiped out that way. So these days it could be better to buy btc with your own money instead of on credit, so even if there is a downtrend you can still keep your btc and ride it to $1m per coin instead of having to sell it in a downtrend to pay off your credit resulting in you missing gains.

Also 10 years ago when Bitcoin was $200 each the marketcap was 3 billion, today the Bitcoin marketcap is 2.4 trillion. Almost 1000x bigger. Orders of magnitude of more money needs to be put into bitcoin today to move it the exact same percentage as back then. in 2015 if btc marketcap went up another 3 billion that would double the price. Today for the price to double another 2.4 Trillion needs to be added to the marketcap. Of course literally $2.4 T dollars don't need to be injected but you get what I'm saying, we're on a bigger scale now and it takes much more to move the price. We aren't seeing frequent 40% daily pumps and weekly 10x increase in price anymore for a reason.

For clarification I still think btc is going to $1m per bitcoin, so of course if you time your credit buys properly you'll come out ahead but do you really think you can time it? The risk of getting caught in a downturn is really big and that could wipe you out.

And sorry if this seemed like a doomer post, I don't want this to be taken as a bearish post because I'm still super bullish on Bitcoin and always have been. I just think the central banks are now greatly manipulating bitcoin and wiping people out so they can get even more of peoples bitcoin and control the supply as much as possible. This is all a big plan by them to manipulate Bitcoin like they do everything else, they don't want people owning btc they want it all for themselves. A lot of these ETFs, btc treasuries and other recent tradfi integrations of bitcoin will be used by the government to control the supply of Bitcoin.

And even though I say the risk of buying credit on bitcoin is huge today and I wouldn't recommend it some part of me still wants to beat this government and tradfi trash that is trying to corrupt Bitcoin lol. I think I can beat them at their own game so I still have some credit btc positions open. I'm happy I was able to use the tradfi system against them back then and use their credit to purchase real currency btc. That's really the moral in all this, going against fiat and doing your best to make Bitcoin prevail.",10 year ago made thread buying 85 bitcoin $20k student line credit instead going college everyone ridiculed worked back here wouldnt recommend buying btc credit today here thread 10 year ago buying 85 btc $20k student line credit instead going college 1 2 3 4 thread lot got removed mod got banned sub well thats much people back im seeing lot post lately people asking buying bitcoin credit 2015 turned 18 bought 85 bitcoin around 235 $20k student line credit instead going college used money buy bitcoin talked back everyone said idiot worked great bitcoin still nascent technology time along holding initial position doubled many time greatly grew stack problem buying bitcoin credit day free market alone no longer really determines price btc leaving open wiped financial entity manipulation lot government corporate central bank game played bitcoin today early bitcoin day thing happened organically simple supply demand caused btc price go also fact new technology even wasnt demand btc point back could still say believe tech tech solid would pay line bitcoin go mainstream resulting btc price exploding well dream realized bitcoin went mainstream fact bitcoin mainstream also mean achieved deeper integration financial institution government entity manipulating price bitcoin like traditional asset bitcoin manufactured downtrend price caused financial institution let say buy bitcoin credit one day could wiped lose everything not organic sell pressure governmenttradfi manipulation pushing price wasnt problem back enough money decide btc pump dump literally print fiat unfortunately many space today care btc going so dump fiat play directly hand financial institution central bank entity cause recession maybe create another one buy credit get wiped way so day could better buy btc money instead credit so even downtrend still keep btc ride $1m per coin instead sell downtrend pay credit resulting missing gain also 10 year ago bitcoin $200 marketcap 3 billion today bitcoin marketcap 24 trillion almost 1000x bigger order magnitude money need put bitcoin today move exact percentage back 2015 btc marketcap went another 3 billion would double price today price double another 24 trillion need added marketcap course literally $24 dollar dont need injected get im saying bigger scale take much move price arent seeing frequent 40 daily pump weekly 10x increase price anymore reason clarification still think btc going $1m per bitcoin so course time credit buy properly youll come ahead really think time risk getting caught downturn really big could wipe sorry seemed like doomer post dont want taken bearish post im still super bullish bitcoin always think central bank greatly manipulating bitcoin wiping people so get even people bitcoin control supply much possible big plan manipulate bitcoin like everything else dont want people owning btc want lot etf btc treasury recent tradfi integration bitcoin used government control supply bitcoin even though say risk buying credit bitcoin huge today wouldnt recommend part still want beat government tradfi trash trying corrupt bitcoin lol think beat game so still credit btc position open im happy able use tradfi system back use credit purchase real currency btc thats really moral going fiat best make bitcoin prevail,neutral,1,0.6603102377414704,0.3333333333333333,positive,positive,neutral,0.06894795273542403,0.6603102377414704,0.27074181883633136

dogecoin is down around 20 percent for the year despite being the leading memecoin. shiba inu dropped about 40 percent, and pepe fell close to 50 percent. solana based bonk has also declined, though less sharply.

bitcoin‚Äôs rally is being driven by institutional money through us spot etfs and corporate treasuries accumulating billions in btc. this is long term capital, not short term speculation.

data from solana and ethereum shows new meme token creation has slowed significantly compared to mid 2025 levels, suggesting the speculative cycle has cooled.

at the same time, prediction markets are seeing rising participation. platforms like polymarket and kalshi have drawn more attention and volume in recent months, suggesting some retail traders have shifted their focus.

the tax complexity between these two strategies is notable. bitcoin holders with long term positions have straightforward cost basis calculations, while memecoin traders cycling through multiple tokens face dozens of taxable events. platforms like awaken.tax are seeing this divergence reflected in user behavior - bitcoin positions need minimal tracking updates while active memecoin portfolios require constant transaction monitoring across multiple chains.

some memecoins like doge and pepe are forming potential bullish reversal patterns on charts, but they remain speculative plays that rely heavily on community sentiment.

James Butterfill from CoinShares said the surge reflects a delayed reaction to the Federal Reserve‚Äôs rate cut, weaker U.S. jobs data, and renewed concerns about government stability after the shutdown. Investors appear to be rotating toward crypto amid broader uncertainty.

The rally coincided with Bitcoin hitting a new all-time high above $125,000. Bitcoin dominated inflows with $3.55 billion, setting its own record, while Ethereum saw $1.48 billion, Solana $706 million, and XRP $219 million.

Total assets under management in crypto funds crossed $250 billion for the first time, reaching $254 billion. That signals institutional capital is not just entering but staying.

The SEC‚Äôs partial shutdown could slow ETF reviews, but analysts compared it to a ‚Äúrain delay‚Äù rather than a full halt. Meanwhile, product development continues globally, several issuers launched new ETH-based funds even as U.S. regulators paused routine work.

The mix of record inflows, political tension, and ongoing fund launches highlights a familiar pattern: during periods of uncertainty, capital often moves toward decentralized assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum, seen as stores of value outside traditional systems.

If you are shifting meaningful capital it is worth remembering taxes and reporting. Tools like awaken tax quietly pull in exchange and fund activity so you can track realized gains and estimated liabilities without digging through dozens of CSVs.

1nyvt0k,watched bitcoin go from 40k to 125k and somehow made nothing. lost most of it somewhere else instead,"january 2024, bitcoin was around 42k. i kept checking prices every day, waiting for the perfect entry. 45k hit, then 50k, 60k, 70k. every time i thought, ‚Äútoo late, it‚Äôll correct soon.‚Äù

finally bought a small amount at 50k. not much, because this had to be near the top. bitcoin kept climbing anyway. my position barely moved compared to the overall rally.

that‚Äôs when the solana casino started looking tempting. memes, screenshots, 50x overnight gains. bitcoin felt slow, safe, boring.

so i jumped in. first few meme coins worked , doubled here, tripled there. then came the dumps. 80 percent gone in two days. liquidity vanished. stop losses didn‚Äôt matter when there was no one to sell to.

meanwhile bitcoin kept pushing , 80k, 90k, 100k, 120k, 125k. i watched the whole move while trying to make back sol losses.

ended up with less than if i‚Äôd just bought bitcoin once and forgotten about it.

the real lesson? checking charts every day doesn‚Äôt make you smart, it makes you emotional. you start seeing every dip as danger, every pump as too late, and every sideways move as a waste of time.

your brain craves bigger moves. bitcoin up 10 percent feels dull. you start needing the casino.

the ones who made money weren‚Äôt on telegram chasing 100x coins. they bought bitcoin, closed the tab, and lived their lives.

i watched bitcoin triple and still ended down... not because i was dumb, but because i paid too much attention.

funny enough, when i finally started using awaken.tax to sync my trades, i could actually see how much i‚Äôd overtraded. every flip, every panic move right there in the report. hurt to look at, but that‚Äôs when i learned what ‚Äúless is more‚Äù really means.

1nzdnib,Where‚Äôs the Bitcoin FOMO?,"**BTC All-time high, but no FOMO**

Bitcoin (BTC) just hit a new all-time high over the weekend. That‚Äôs huge, right? But if you‚Äôre scrolling through X or Reddit, it doesn‚Äôt feel like the previous 2017 en 2021 bull runs. No crazy FOMO, no ‚Äúmy Uber driver‚Äôs buying BTC vibes. Retail investors especially new ones are fading Bitcoin, and I think it‚Äôs because the risk-reward just isn‚Äôt exciting anymore. Retail thrives on asymmetric bets, 10x, 20x, or more. At $124K, BTC feels like crypto‚Äôs Apple stock: reliable, but not the rocket fuel it was a decade ago.

**Retail‚Äôs Psychology: x2-5 is not enough**

Retail‚Äôs bored with BTC‚Äôs ‚Äúdigital gold‚Äù narrative and chasing projects with smaller market caps and bigger potential. Altcoins, DeFi, AI tokens, and even meme coins are soaking up the speculative energy. Why? According to retail investors a $100M market cap coin at $1 has a better shot at 10x-ing than BTC‚Äôs. Retail wants the next Bitcoin, not the current one. They‚Äôre hunting for projects that can replicate BTC‚Äôs early-day magic, where $1K could become a house down payment.

**Bitcoin‚Äôs Maturing, But Retail Wants Speed**

Bitcoin‚Äôs not smashing it in the retail sense because crypto‚Äôs growing up. Institutional players, ETFs, and even sovereign funds are driving price action now.

Bitcoin (BTC) just hit a new all-time high over the weekend. That‚Äôs huge, right? But if you‚Äôre scrolling through X or Reddit, it doesn‚Äôt feel like the previous 2017 en 2021 bull runs. No crazy FOMO, no ‚Äúmy Uber driver‚Äôs buying BTC vibes. Retail investors especially new ones are fading Bitcoin, and I think it‚Äôs because the risk-reward just isn‚Äôt exciting anymore. Retail thrives on asymmetric bets, 10x, 20x, or more. At $124K, BTC feels like crypto‚Äôs Apple stock: reliable, but not the rocket fuel it was a decade ago.

**Retail‚Äôs Psychology: x2-5 is not enough**

Retail‚Äôs bored with BTC‚Äôs ‚Äúdigital gold‚Äù narrative and chasing projects with smaller market caps and bigger potential. Altcoins, DeFi, AI tokens, and even meme coins are soaking up the speculative energy. Why? According to retail investors a $100M market cap coin at $1 has a better shot at 10x-ing than BTC‚Äôs. Retail wants the next Bitcoin, not the current one. They‚Äôre hunting for projects that can replicate BTC‚Äôs early-day magic, where $1K could become a house down payment.

**Bitcoin‚Äôs Maturing, But Retail Wants Speed**

Bitcoin‚Äôs not smashing it in the retail sense because crypto‚Äôs growing up. Institutional players, ETFs, and even sovereign funds are driving price action now. That‚Äôs great for validation, BTC‚Äôs a legit asset class, with fiscal dominance and debasement fears fueling its rise. But retail knows BTC is a big player coin now. Wall Street owns Bitcoin.

1nyyb3r,Bitcoin has cleared its prior all time high from two months ago.,"As you know, BTC has cleared its prior all time high from two months ago. I also posted about the BTC risk metric this cycle, it hasn‚Äôt spent time in the heated zone yet, only a brief spike into the low 80s (red).

Right now: risk = 60 around $125K. BTC has been living around this risk band for roughly 2 years (Dec 2023 till now).

History: when parabolic runs started from risk \~50 (purple):

* Dec 2012 (\~$13): ran until Dec 2013, risk \~94, price \~$1.1K (\~1 year run).
* Jun 2016 (\~$500): ran until Dec 2017, risk \~95, price \~$19,500 (\~1.5 year run).
* Oct 2020 (\~$13K), special case (post COVID liquidity): Hit risk 93 in Mar 2021 ($63K), and ultimately topped in Nov 2021 with risk \~75 at \~$67.5K (\~2 year run).

This cycle: BTC started from risk \~50 in Dec 2023. It‚Äôs been almost 2 years, but we still haven‚Äôt seen sustained time in the 80‚Äì100 heated zone. Historically, each cycle has stretched a bit longer (\~ 0.5 year), so BTC could have \~0.5 year left to run, it needs to spend time in that 80-100 band before peaking.

Levels to watch:

Once BTC clears the 60 risk area decisively, the model points to the 70s risk zone next, roughly $147K on my Dynamic Risk Range.

Bottom line: I‚Äôm looking for sustained time in 80-100 before calling a cycle top.

1nx6e6w,BNB: It‚Äôs All in the BTC Ratio,"If you don‚Äôt know what coin season is or how to choose your altcoin, I‚Äôve already written about it few weeks ago.

Altcoin season is when alts outperform Bitcoin. Most likely, alt dominance will come back, and the best survivors are the ones that have a history of ratio consolidation.

BNB is a great example of survival. Let‚Äôs look at the BNB/BTC ratio monthly chart.

(You can paste it like this on TradingView: CRYPTO:BNBUSD/CRYPTO:BTCUSD)

The historical cycle:

* During 2018 - 2021: The BNB/BTC ratio formed a double bottom on the monthly chart, consolidated for a while, and then, in the late cycle when alts pumped, it quickly retraced back to its ratio all time high and broke out.
* This cycle: We can clearly see another double bottom on the ratio in 2024 and early 2025. Q4 is where altcoin season should play out. That gives BNB a high chance of retracing back to its 2022 ratio all time high of 1BNB = 0.0175 BTC.

Now, do the math:

During alt season, BTC can easily heat up to the risk zone of 70. According to the Dynamic Risk Range, BTC at 70 \~ $145K.

So the possible price of BNB would be:

$145K \* 0.0175 = $2,537.5

That‚Äôs a modest 200% from the current price. Of course, it could go higher if BTC pushes further into the risk zone.

And don‚Äôt forget ETH, the blue chip, king of alts. ETH leads alt season: it breaks ATH first, and it usually lasts until the very end of the cycle. In both 2018 and 2021 tops, BNB topped right when ETH was peaking, with ETH risk in the 90 range. It‚Äôs reasonable to use the ETH risk metric as ur navigator for altcoins.

I love the survivors, they‚Äôve stood the test of time. The market will always be volatile, but that‚Äôs the game.

1o2oo9f,Why Pike takes an LP-first approach while Fluid builds around debt: two different paths to capital efficiency,"Capital efficiency has become the north star in DeFi. For years, liquidity either sat in lending pools or AMMs ‚Äî doing just one job at a time.

Protocols like Fluid deserve credit for changing that. Their Smart Debt system abstracts borrowing into programmable positions, letting users earn trading fees to offset loan costs ‚Äî even achieving negative APRs in correlated pairs like USDC‚ÄìUSDT or wstETH‚ÄìETH.

But this debt-first model comes with trade-offs:

* Impermanent loss risk during depegs or volatility
* Dynamic debt ratios that shift unpredictably during stress events
* High user complexity, especially in managing ranges and leverage

Pike flips the model ‚Äî from debt-first to LP-first.  
It starts with liquidity providers, giving their LP tokens utility as collateral while maintaining isolation and stability.

Key differentiators:

* Built-in DEX with peg protection: LPs can earn swap fees *and* borrow without leaving their positions.
* Dual-oracle system: Ensures accurate LP valuation.
* Isolated markets: Each asset gets its own market to contain systemic risk.

1o22t0f,RiskFi: Xerberus - one of those projects genuinely committed to development over speculation,"I have been following Xerberus for a while now and want to briefly showcase why i believe this project has real potential.

**What Xerberus does**

Xerberus is developing a blockchain for crypto asset risk analysis. The goal is to provide on-chain risk ratings that objectively show how decentralized, liquid and trustworthy a token really is.

Instead of marketing buzz or wild promises it is all about data and transparency. The exact things institutional players have been missing in DeFi. That is why their main focus with regard to onboarding is to approach institutional players e.g. crypto hedge funds etc.

**Current Progress**

* Whitepaper and governance framework live
* $XER token: 1B max supply, currently \~29 % circulating; FDV at around $ 13M
* Since September 23rd the token is additionally (to XER/ADA via Minswap) available via Uniswap (stealth launch - marketing for the ETH side is intended for the coming months)
* Doxxed founder said in Discord channel they aim for a FDV of around $ 100M in the upcoming months

**Why it matters**

While many projects fight for attention, Xerberus is building quietly and methodically and looks for reliable partnerships. The teams focus is on organic growth and bringing in institutions (funds, protocols, risk platforms), that actually use the product and not only trade the token.

If they deliver, Xerberus could become for crypto the Standard & Poor's for public companies.

1o14n1e,From Traditional Brokers to Onchain Trading ‚Äì My Transition Experience,"I‚Äôve been reading a lot here about how onchain trading is evolving, and it made me reflect on how far things have come. I used to rely heavily on traditional brokers with limited hours, slow execution, and random ‚Äúmaintenance‚Äù periods that always seemed to happen during volatility. It felt like I was missing out on opportunities.

Earlier this year I started exploring onchain alternatives more seriously. Bitget‚Äôs Onchain platform surprised me with how smooth it felt. Being able to trade tokenized stocks and ETFs 24/7 without restrictions changed the way I approach my strategy. No more waiting for markets to open or dealing with locked funds.

What also stood out was the integration of AI tools with trading. The GetAgent feature provides real-time onchain insights and token analysis, which helps cut through the noise and avoid scam copies that still circulate in smaller DEXs.

DeFi keeps breaking boundaries, and it really feels like we‚Äôre getting closer to a universal trading environment that connects both onchain and traditional assets in one experience.

1o0bzfz,Why forward testing is the real test for trading strategies ‚Äî not just backtests,"Hey everyone,

I‚Äôve seen tons of strategies that look amazing in backtests ‚Äî then collapse the moment they hit live data. It‚Äôs a classic trap. That‚Äôs why I wrote a piece recently about the importance of forward testing, and I wanted to share the distilled version here for anyone building or using algorithmic trading systems.

**Why Backtests Aren‚Äôt Enough**

Backtesting tells you how a strategy *would have* performed in the past. The problem? It‚Äôs often overfitted to historical data and market conditions that may never repeat.

Markets evolve, liquidity changes, slippage happens, APIs fail ‚Äî and your model doesn‚Äôt care.

**Forward Testing = The Real Validation**

Forward testing (aka paper trading) uses unseen, real-time market data with the same rules and logic as your final strategy ‚Äî but without risking real money.

It‚Äôs the bridge between ‚Äúlooks good on paper‚Äù and ‚Äúactually works in the wild.‚Äù

When done properly, it reveals:

* How strategies handle latency, slippage, and liquidity gaps
* Whether your trade logic generalizes to new data
* Operational risks (feeds breaking, orders rejected, etc.)

**Trade Dependence Matters**

Most people assume each trade is independent ‚Äî it‚Äôs not.  
Losing streaks and clustering are *real phenomena* that distort metrics like Sharpe or drawdown if ignored.

In my research, simulating both independent and Markov-dependent trade sequences gave a much clearer picture of true risk exposure.

**Operational Testing Is Underrated**

Even great logic can fail in production because of human factors ‚Äî API permission errors, network issues, or unexpected data feed delays.  
Forward testing helps catch these before real funds are at stake.

**My Take**

Backtests build confidence.  
Forward tests build trust ‚Äî in your model, execution, and assumptions.

If you‚Äôre deploying trading bots or building your own, make forward testing a *non-negotiable* step.",Extra-Compote7143,2025-10-07 18:22:20,1,0.67,5,defi,https://www.reddit.com/r/defi/comments/1o0bzfz/why_forward_testing_is_the_real_test_for_trading/,https://reddit.com/r/defi/comments/1o0bzfz/why_forward_testing_is_the_real_test_for_trading/,True,:discuss: Discussion,2025-10-10 15:07:40.020650,"Why forward testing is the real test for trading strategies ‚Äî not just backtests Hey everyone,

‚ú¶ Project decision making   
‚ú¶ Hiring from OG's with ownership stake  
‚ú¶ A %age of revenue sharing

Credit default swap is a new primitive and it needs a set of curious minds to take it forward. Currently, users holding any stablecoin or token can put in a credit default swap and start earning hedging premiums. CDS is currently hedging for tokens against price dump of upto 20%. 

Users holding USDA+ stablecoin can earn yields from option premiums. 

**Risks with the dCDS**  
1. Users in dCDS are taking on the ETH delta risk so if ETH value falls then a proportional amount will be deducted from dCDS users. They are compensated through hedging premiums for taking on this risk. 

2. Users can mint USDA+ stablecoin against ETH or cbBTC. The hedging of collateral price fall is only limited till 20% price dump. As the price touches 20%, then the collateral is liquidated and no downside protection is provided.

They revealed the new AgentKit Agent Builder with the goal of improving the automation of workflows. It got me thinking about the trajectory DeFi is growing at. I believe the future is clear, especially after today:

DeFi's Scaling **Fast**. Humans **Can't Keep Up**.  


Let's break it down.  
  
Solana DeFi just hit $13 billion in TVL for the first time. Six protocols crossed the billion-dollar mark (SolanaFloor) ‚Äì Jito at $2B, Kamino at $1.61B doing lending. Jupiter processed over a trillion dollars in lifetime volume and captures 90%+ of aggregator activity (@21shares\_us). The infrastructure is actually working.  
  
But here's the reality: only 5-10% of crypto users are actively using their holdings (@rimeissner - Safe co-founder). 62% of crypto users now juggle at least two different wallets, up from 46% a year ago. You see the protocol alerts, you read about liquidations when people can't track exposure across platforms.  
  
Millions of dollars get lost to liquidations every day in DeFi - not because people are reckless, but because liquidation risk is somewhat invisible (@jrdothoughts) when you're managing positions across multiple protocols. Your SOL staked with your favorite validator, USDC earning yield on Kamino, perps open on Drift, liquidity in Meteora, swaps routing through Jupiter - you know each position individually. Your total exposure? Your aggregate liquidation threshold across everything? Mental math across several interfaces.  
  
I am working on something. It's an intelligent command center. One place where you see all your positions across Jupiter, Drift, Kamino, Meteora, Orca, Raydium, DFlow - everything. You get analytics on the full picture: lending, borrowing, your vaults, strategies, every spot and perps position. Your agents do the heavy lifting. They monitor risk profiles around the clock, surface opportunities, execute when conditions hit. You stay in control. Automate what you trust, approve what you don't. Ask for a summary of your exposure, get insights on where your capital's working hardest, automate rebalancing when allocations drift. An all-encompassing perspective with intelligent, agent-driven action.  
  
Visibility doesn't solve it. You need monitoring, alerts, insights, and execution‚Äîacross everything. A system that knows when you're about to get liquidated, spots better yield opportunities before you do, flags portfolio drift, surfaces arbitrage, and acts when your conditions hit. Not another dashboard showing static positions, but active intelligence working 24/7. When 50% of DeFi liquidity is fragmented across chains and you're managing positions across multiple protocols, you need something that understands your full strategy, watches every protocol, catches every opportunity, and executes on your behalf. Manual monitoring doesn't scale when markets move this fast.  
  
Solana TVL doubled in a year. Jupiter processes $700M+ in daily swaps. The activity is compounding. The way I see it, an automated assustant is the ony way you can actually harness it - see everything, understand everything, act on everything - without drowning in interfaces or missing the move because you were checking a different protocol.  
  
DeFi's scaling fast. Humans can't manually track positions across protocols, spot every risk, and execute fast enough. It's clear that the future of DeFI is going to look signifigantly different than it does today. The question is, what do you think that looks like?

1nyjl4g,What's the best risk/reward staking option ?,"Hey everyone,

I've got some money sitting on the side and I'm trying to figure out the smartest way to put it to work. I've been comparing traditional options like index funds in a brokerage account vs crypto staking, and honestly, I'm leaning toward crypto for potentially better returns.

**Here's what I'm looking for:**

* Best risk/reward ratio for staking (or other passive income strategies in crypto)
* Something that's not going to keep me up at night with 50% swings every week
* Preferably established projects, not some sketchy 200% APY memecoin

I know ETH staking is around 3-4%, which seems pretty safe but not amazing compared to what else is out there.

**My questions:**

1. What would YOU stake if you had some extra cash right now?
2. Is there anything with better risk/reward than the usual suspects (ETH, SOL, DOT)?
3. Are there any other strategies besides staking that you'd recommend for passive income?

I'm not looking to gamble everything on the next moonshot, just want to make smarter returns than leaving it in a savings account earning nothing.

1nxx8o9,Borrowing in AAVE vs Binance,"I‚Äôve been comparing borrowing on **AAVE** vs **Binance**, and here are some thoughts:

**Taxable events**

* **AAVE**: Swapping BTC into WBTC creates a taxable event.
* **Binance**: You can post BTC directly as collateral, no need to swap, and there‚Äôs no 3rd-party risk.

**Tax reporting**

* **Binance**: Provides a ready-to-use CSV with transaction history.
* **AAVE**: You have to manage the reporting yourself.

**Collateral flexibility**

* **Binance**: Only one asset can be used as collateral, no mixing.
* **AAVE**: You can combine different assets (ETH, WBTC, LINK, etc.) as collateral, which is very convenient.

**Interest rates**

* Similar overall, but AAVE tends to be lower on average.
* December ‚Äô25 snapshot:
   * Binance: 22% ‚Äì 49%
   * AAVE: 7% ‚Äì 22%

**Custody & trust**

* **Binance**: Requires trust in their custody and compliance with KYC/AML.
* **AAVE**: You maintain self-custody.

**Takeaway**  
Binance feels more convenient, especially for taxes, but the rates are higher. AAVE is cheaper and gives you more control, but with the hassle of reporting and taxable events when converting.

You‚Äôd need to:

* Have the right gas token
* Approve contracts again and again
* Manually bridge assets across chains
* Pray nothing broke mid-flow

For most people, that was way too intimidating.

But recently I‚Äôve noticed a shift. Gasless transactions, bundled approvals, and cleaner onboarding flows are making apps feel a lot closer to Web2, simple, fast, and intuitive. It finally feels like the focus is moving from just building protocols to actually making them usable for everyone.

1nw8zhz,What are the options available for improving blockchain infrastructure in DeFi?,"I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs just me, but one of the biggest problems in DeFi and Web3 that doesn‚Äôt get much attention is infrastructure, specifically how networks handle data, bandwidth, and latency for decentralized applications.

I hadn‚Äôt really thought about this until recently, when I was reading about a few DePIN and infrastructure projects on CMC. A lot of DeFi protocols rely on fast, reliable networks, but many decentralized applications still struggle with delays or bandwidth bottlenecks, which can directly affect user experience and transaction efficiency.

I also realized that contributors, like people running nodes, providing bandwidth, or sharing infrastructure don‚Äôt always have clear ways to participate or get compensated. Even if projects try to incentivize them, it‚Äôs not always obvious how accessible these systems are to average users.

One example I saw is DoubleZero, which aggregates private fiber links into a network optimized for distributed systems and uses a two-ring architecture to manage traffic flow efficiently. It made me think more broadly about the question: what kinds of infrastructure solutions exist in DeFi, and how practical are they for everyday users to participate in?

And one thing I did notice though is top CEXs like Bitget has historically listed some of these DePIN projects early, which raises another question, how important is early access to infrastructure-focused projects for the broader DeFi ecosystem?

1nuyud2,Borrowing Rates - Aave,"I am aware that borrowing pools like Aave v3 for stablecoins like USDT and USDC have variable borrowing rates which are directly adjusted based on utilization of the borrow pool (higher utilization -> higher rates to discourage borrowing and encourage lending).

However, I want to understand what are the key drivers/predictors behind borrowing? What macroeconomic factors/indicators cause higher or lower utilization of the pool? 

I got few answers from ChatGPT that people would use their ETH assets as collateral when they predict it to go up and buy ETH futures with the stablecoins they borrowed.I'm still confused on how that will work as borrow rates might eat up their gains.

Eventually, i realized i didnt need ‚Äúmore apps‚Äù, i needed more focus. Thats when i switched everything over to bitget. Instead of wasting energy hopping between platforms, i kept all my trades in one place. i could move between futures, spot, and even stocks without losing track. funny thing is, once i simplified, my results actually improved.

1ntqq4v,Falcon Finance ($FF): Can diversified collateral make stablecoins safer?,"I‚Äôve been following stablecoin projects for a while, and most of them seem to recycle the same formula: overcollateralized CDPs with ETH or BTC, or fiat-backed reserves. The weak spot has always been concentration risk.

That‚Äôs why I was glued to what Falcon Finance was about, Instead of relying only on one collateral type, it spreads risk across multiple sources, things like basis spreads, funding rate arbitrage, even staking yields.

1nsu6m5,"Uniswap's ""true"" APR","Didn't get a response on r/Uniswap...
I'm wondering to what extent Uniswap's stated APR is BS?

Over 8 days, I tracked the alleged total APR (pool APR + reward APR), which fluctuates (in this case from anywhere between ~8.5% [pool= 0.37, reward= 8.17] and ~31% [pool= 23.15, reward=7.24]). 

I averaged the measurements, and divided by 8 then multiplied by 365, and it seems like the true APR is closer to 7 or 8%., not the >15% regularly claimed by ""total APR"". 

Why is this?? Question: does the ""pool apr"" apply only to the fees? If so, ""total APR"" is pretty misleading, and the risk of IL makes yield farming (in this way) less attractive.

Although I am sure you would've heard of us by now I will give you a run down, we are everywhere on Reddit and are legit by far the strongest community, on other platforms such as X, Stocktwits, Instagram and TikTok we have very strong efforts too. By our social media efforts alone we have a community strength that would typically equate to a valuation in the billions, but Kendu goes a step further than that with IRL efforts.

On a side note: Kendu is only the 2nd coin to ever reach 50k Certik votes for the free audit, the only other coin to manage this was Pepe!!! Here is a link to the Certik audit:¬†[https://skynet.certik.com/projects/kendu](https://skynet.certik.com/projects/kendu)

Anyways back to the IRL efforts, we have over 20 community led initiatives from a street team(KenduSTREET) to a coffee business to a merch business and many others. Since these are community led so many will be waiting for higher levels to release their initiative since they will have more money to play with, the Kendu wave will only grow. IRL efforts are gonna be so important and decisive for retail investment because it shows¬†**Proof of Humanity**¬†that the community is actually real people with real investments. It also helps bridge crypto to the real world.

Kendu is self growing, many of these businesses like Kendu Video Games are making a treasury which will buy Kendu from a portion of the profits that they will make from the initiative, this is gonna keep Kendu's price stable and will help us push for the higher levels.

Kendu is arguably the best investment rn, at 15 million market cap there is so much room for growth compared to projects already in the hundreds of millions or even the billions.

This is just the start, remember people didn't make life changing money buying SHIB at 30 billion, to access a life of luxury you will have to buy the next Shib or the next Doge or the next Pepe, at the lower levels under 100 million mc...

Neiro co-lead Space Cowboy, in his recent CCN feature, shared how the project is evolving beyond meme status into a movement with real values, community impact, and long-term vision within the Web3 and DeFi space.

At Token2049, he spotlighted the partnership with Serenity, unveiling the first co-branded Neiro sAxess biometric hardware card. This physical wallet brings together secure self-custody and meaningful impact, allowing users to protect their digital assets while contributing to animal shelters worldwide. With fingerprint-based access, there are no logins and no passwords, putting ownership fully in the hands of the user, a true reflection of DeFi principles.

This collaboration proves that Web3 innovation and social responsibility can move together with purpose. It highlights how two different ecosystems, digital culture and real-world action, can find a common ground and shape a more conscious direction for the future of decentralized finance.

Even though the market looked bullish overall, my portfolio barely moved. I was holding bags like $COAI and $ZEN both with strong fundamentals so instead of panicking, I decided to stay patient and wait for the right narrative to take off.

And when it finally did, the breakout was huge.

My biggest conviction play was $COAI. I was drawn to its strong AI narrative from the start, and when I noticed the Bitget team teasing a potential listing, I had a feeling this wasn‚Äôt going to be an average debut. I entered at $0.40 when it went live on the CEX and joined some of the launch events to increase my holdings without extra risk.

Fast forward $COAI is now sitting around $5.30, marking a **1,225% gain** from my entry.

This trade reminded me that conviction and patience often pay better than chasing hype. In crypto, you don‚Äôt need to catch every pump ‚Äî just hold steady until your chosen narrative rotates into focus.

1o0fkja,"Why Kendu will be the next big Cult coin, and why its the perfect time to buy in","Kendu has finally broken out of its long downtrend and reclaimed the 0.000015 range. That level acted as resistance for months and is now holding as support. The price structure has tightened, volume is stabilizing, and selling pressure has nearly vanished. It looks like the quiet stage before a proper move.

The strongest part of this setup isn‚Äôt the chart, it‚Äôs the holders. Almost 9,000 wallets have held Kendu for more than a year, and around 5,000 for six to twelve months. That is rare. It means a huge part of the supply sits with people who already proved they don‚Äôt panic-sell. When long-term conviction holders dominate the base, breakouts usually last longer.

The distribution looks natural. No giant bundles, no contract manipulation, no suspicious inflows. Just a steady curve of real EOAs holding through the cycle. The mix of short-term wallets keeps liquidity moving while the long-term ones anchor the floor. That balance is exactly what defines the early phase of a cult coin, organic growth that forms its own rhythm.

Kendu‚Äôs identity gives it an edge too. It has turned into a shared brand people can actually build around. You see it in the community projects, the small Kendu-branded products, and the memes that keep spreading on their own. It‚Äôs the kind of ecosystem that grows from participation, not marketing.

The broader market timing lines up. Bitcoin and Ethereum are trending up, smaller caps are starting to wake, and liquidity is rotating back into memes. When that happens, the coins with clean supply and strong communities usually move first.

Kendu went through silence, held its structure, and is still standing with a chart that finally flipped back to strength. There are very few coins with that kind of survival record this year.

This isn‚Äôt hype or advice, it‚Äôs simple observation. The data backs it up, the structure confirms it, and the community still shows up.

Kendu looks ready for its next phase.

The promise of #crypto is freedom, privacy, and no middlemen. Yet convenience is quietly reshaping the landscape, introducing more intermediaries than ever. User-friendly designs and familiar logins come at a steep price, the erosion of true control.

üîê **Cloud-Stored Keys Undermine Decentralization**

Many hot wallets now push users to store seed phrases in the cloud. It feels convenient and secure, but it‚Äôs a trap. Centralized servers are vulnerable to hacks and leaks, and relying on them shifts control away from you. Self-custody is no longer the default, identity logins are taking over.

1o0hsjl,"Kendu, Pepe and SRY are becoming collectible Pitpets in a new crypto gaming universe","This might be the first time you‚Äôll see your favorite meme coins play together instead of begging for attention.

The Sorry for Winning team has been hosting SRY Games Week, revealing piece by piece how their upcoming game universe will work, and it‚Äôs shaping up to be something way bigger than just another click-to-earn.

It started with a full art reveal showing off a hand-drawn world led by the Lorises, created under the direction of the project‚Äôs lead artist. He‚Äôs making sure every piece of art is crafted by hand. Some early ones are AI-assisted for speed, but all are being redrawn manually.

Then came the dopamine machines:

üé∞¬†**Ready, Set, GO!**¬†a¬†**FUEL**\-powered slot game where your trades generate spins to receive¬†**COINS**¬†and LOOT.  
üöÄ¬†**Sorry for Mooning**¬†a high-stakes ladder game, that‚Äôs all about timing and nerves.

And now, the biggest drop so far,¬†**Pitpets**¬†üêæ

Collectible creatures you can level, evolve, and battle with in both PvE and PvP. There will be over 100 at launch, and yes,¬†**Pepe, Shib, and Kendu**¬†are all confirmed to be in the first lineup. Adding Kendu is a small homage because both devs have been Kendu holders since the very beginning and love the community.

Each Pitpet has unique stats, evolutions, and elements that tie directly into gameplay. The game draws inspiration from dopamine-heavy titles like¬†**Team Fight Tactics**¬†and¬†**Cloverpit**, mixed with progression systems from¬†**Summoners War**,¬†**Dragon City**, and¬†**Star Wars Galaxy of Heroes**, except this time it‚Äôs all powered by real crypto mechanics.

Here‚Äôs how it all ties together:

‚Ä¢ Trades generate¬†**FUEL**  
‚Ä¢¬†**FUEL**¬†is converted into¬†**COINS**¬†through¬†**Ready, Set, GO!**, similar to¬†**CoinMaster**  
‚Ä¢¬†**COINS**¬†power arcade games, loot, and Pitpet progression  
‚Ä¢ Volume drives rewards and scarcity across the whole system

Games Week continues until Friday, so there‚Äôs still more to come. But what‚Äôs already been shown feels like a crossover between crypto, gacha, and dopamine gaming done right.

This integration will bring zero-knowledge proof technology and decentralized identity verification to SK Planet‚Äôs 28 million users and 95,000 merchant partners, giving users control over how their data is shared and verified. The system will use Moca Network‚Äôs AIR Account and AIR Identity, which let businesses verify user data with explicit consent while keeping data ownership in the user‚Äôs hands.


SK Planet‚Äôs Chief Business Officer, Kyosu Kim, said the collaboration will expand their OKI Club rewards program and let users earn MOCA Coin while maintaining privacy and ownership of their personal data.

A collection of only 410 NFTs, a whopping 60% of the revenue generated goes back to the KENDU treasury wallet in the form of Eth. With 55% of the collection minted, over $4,000 worth of ETH has already been sent to the treasury. In the future, holders of the NFTs will get to vote via Snapshot governance.

1nzevrg,Klink Finance: Connecting Web2 Affiliate Marketing to Web3 Expansion,"https://preview.redd.it/bzo4zt5ssgtf1.jpg?width=680&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=28aa8943f3528e7406e8c27c0bc09b3f567485f1

While the Web2 affiliate marketing industry rakes in over $17 billion annually, it's clear that Web3 and emerging digital ecosystems are still playing catchup when it comes to performance based user growth. That's where Klink Finance steps in and it's doing more than just filling the gap. It's redefining how advertisers, users, and platforms connect in the digital age.

**What Is Klink Finance?**

Klink Finance is a web3 global online earnings platform and affiliate offer network that links users, advertisers, and partners across both Web2 and Web3. Think of it as a hybrid engine, it supports traditional advertisers while simultaneously incentivizing users and aldso adopt Web3 technologies. This dual approach creates a win-win scenario Web2 advertisers get access to cost effective user acquisition, and Web3 platforms gain traction through native infrastructure built for performance marketing.

**Why It Matters**

Web2 advertisers are struggling with skyrocketing acquisition costs. The old models are no longer sustainable, and the need for incentivized user acquisition has never been greater. Klink's model flips the script by offering a community driven, reward based system that benefits both advertisers and users. It's not just about clicks anymore it's about meaningful engagement and value exchange.

Since launching its community Wealth Creation Platform in April 2024, Klink has amassed over 850,000 active members. More than 500 advertisers have already partnered with Klink, including reputable platform like Coinbase, Bybit, Ledger, Binance, Sorare, Revolut, WireX, and Nexo. These proof that Klink is fast becoming the go to solution for Web3 advertising, and earning tech.

The platform's offer API is currently in beta, with  40+ platforms on the waitlist. These include dApps, gaming ecosystems, Web3 media outlets, and blockchain mini-apps all eager to integrate Klink's offers directly into their user experiences. 

Klink's airdrop launchpad has already hosted 10 major campaigns, and distributed over $500K in airdrop tokens directly to users.  $KLINK token which TGE will happen on October 7, 2025. Is the utility token that fuels all affiliate and advertising spend on the platform. It's the connective tissue between advertiser budgets and user activity, creating a self sustaining token economy that rewards participation and drives demand.

 By bridging the gap between Web2 and Web3, it's creating a new paradigm where users are rewarded, advertisers see real ROI, and platforms grow organically. Whether you're an advertiser, a Web3 enthusiast, or just someone looking to earn online, Klink is worth watching and joining.

1nymysp,Sneak peek into the new Hangout feature coming on Vooz,"As mentioned in the last few posts, we are developing a new Hangouts feature on Vooz. Once the location and gender filters goes live, we will go full throttle on the Hangouts one.

What is this Hangout feature? Hangouts are small groups which users can join through audio, video or text, and have fun together. Anyone can create their own hangout and let users join through audio, video or text. As the creator and mod of your hangout, you get to determine how to run the hangout. Users can share their screen, stream movies, watch youtube together etc. There will be several categories and users can join any hangout from any category they like. Users can also gift in those hangout groups and do other fun things. For example, any user can send some $VOOZ to the hangout creator's wallet, something like that.

This is a super fun feature which hasn't been implemented by any other anonymous video chat platform yet. Next time someone asks you how is Vooz different, show them this. We keep on doing new stuff on our platform, which no other Omegle variant is doing. Till now we are the only video chat platform to integrate our SVOOZ token into payments on our site. We gave a 50% discount on premium features for Web3 users who pays through SVOOZ. We are here for 10 months now, and I bet you will see us 1 year down the line too, still grinding! Load up on SVOOZ when it's still under 1M!

1nxz4np,Uptober Is Here‚Ä¶Buy Kendu,"UPTOBER IS HERE AND KENDU IS ALREADY UP 70% OVER THE PAST 3 DAYS!!! But seriously, this is just a drop in the ocean for what is yet to come. Bitcoin and ETH have also already responded well with them being up around 6% and 10% respectively...yet again this is only a drop in the ocean for what is yet to come.

[Kendu Chad, Ruben drinking an energy drink everyday until Kendu hits 100 million market cap](https://reddit.com/link/1nxz4np/video/i8xiphdkk4tf1/player)

October is always a good month for crypto and you can probs make money investing in majority of things rn, but you will make the most money by investing in projects that will perform well whether its October or not. Now is the time to get in though, up 70% already and things are just gonna heat up more and more and more, imo and this is NFA Kendu will not be below 100 million market cap by the end of this month. I couldn't tell you how high we will go because it's impossible and would just be a guess. Things move very very quickly in crypto and you are about to find out if you are brand new. For example Shib 1000x in 36 days, going from 22 million to 22 billion market cap. You could have literally turned $1000 into $1,000,000 in just over a month...

Kendu rn is arguably the best small cap to invest in, a lot of signs point to in terms of 2021 price action, Kendu being the next Shiba Inu or the next Doge. From Kendu being number 1 on Capitoday, to Kendu having the strongest Reddit and Stocktwits presence with a very strong X presence, Kendu is really setting new levels to what a community can achieve. We are doing all of this whilst also revolutionising the way memecoins will build in the future with an insane catalogue of IRL efforts.

Here is the list of them:

* Kendu Energy
* Kendu Coffee
* Kendu Merch
* Kendu Hotdog Stand in Florida
* Kendu animation¬†

This is absolutely insane, all done from the average community member too. All of this below 20 million market cap, Kendu is genuinely unmatched and this¬†**Proof of Humanity**¬†will carry a lot of weight once retail comes.

$VOOZ has been hovering under 500k mcap for quite sometime now. We dipped a bit, but hold strong. This is just the calm before the storm. We have been working hard everyday no matter the price. We integrated $Vooz into payments on our platform, we burned 1m tokens and bought back 1300$ worth $VOOZ already. We released our own merch that ships worldwide. We scaled the Vooz platform to 300k monthly users. All this is still small compared to what we are building next.

We are bringing location and gender filters, an unmoderated Vooz clone and a group hangout feature (which no other anonymous video chat platform has done yet). We have big ambitions, ambition to become the best (and right now the only) anonymous video chat platform on the internet, with its own token. 1 $VOOZ = 1$ is not a bluff, we are aiming for it, and working hard to make it happen!!

üöÄ AI-Driven Trading with TBIG & VAIX: A Glimpse into the Future of Tokenized Assets The intersection of AI and tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) is opening new doors for traders, investors, and hedge funds. The TBIG token (exchange-traded tokenized high-value asset) and the VAIX AI model token are two of the latest innovations bringing AI-powered decision-making directly into trading strategies. Here‚Äôs what makes them interesting:

Returns: The Core Focus Like any financial product, the priority is returns. TBIG optimizes performance by leveraging: Advanced data engineering pipelines Historical backtesting that accounts for slippage and partial fills Algorithms designed to adapt to market conditions

Access to Frontier AI Models TBIG tokens unlock metered access to cutting-edge AI models including: ChatGPT Claude Gemini VAIX & Vector Embedding Models VAIX tokens specifically enable deeper access to datasets, while TBIG is required for basket operations (AI prompting, context engineering, querying, filtering).

1-Click Trade Execution With TBIG, you can: Build a basket & trade instantly View portfolio value & basket price Open and close trading sessions seamlessly with exchange integrations

Technical Analysis Filters Traders get access to 100+ technical indicators as filters and screeners, including: MACD Fibonacci retracements Sentiment analysis Many more (community decides what‚Äôs implemented next) This allows smarter allocation ‚Äî overweighting assets that are undervalued and underweighting those that are overbought.

üì± Mobile App & UI A mobile app is in development to make trading, execution, and community interaction even faster and easier.

TBIGS: Inverse TBIG for Hedged Strategies Works like an inverse ETF. Always trades opposite to TBIG. Provides a built-in hedge for TBIG or any basket trade.

AI-driven trading is no longer theoretical ‚Äî it‚Äôs here. By combining tokenized assets (RWAs), dynamic rebalancing, technical analysis, and frontier AI models, TBIG and VAIX are paving the way for a new era of trading strategies. If you‚Äôre curious about the future of AI + finance, this is one company worth keeping an eye on.

We got a lot of Omegle variants popping up every week ever since Omegle closed down. But none of them has the vision Vooz has. Users can pick their topic of interest on the website and match with similar users through either text or video chat. We got a lot of group chatrooms on the site, something a lot of Omegle copy pastas don't have. In the coming weeks, we are bringing location and gender filters, an unmoderated Vooz clone and hangout feature on the platform. Hangouts will be our big release, something no other anonymous video chat platform has. An user can create a hangout group and other users can join, and chill together over audio, text or video. They can watch movies, YouTube, do livestreams together and many other fun stuff. Vooz is different!

Also Vooz is the only video chat website that caters to both Web2 and Web3 users. You hold $VOOZ, spend it on our platform and get access to premium features like account unban, gender and location filters etc. A lot of these $Vooz spent are burnt every weekend. Don't underestimate Vooz ever!!

- Activities include holding COTI/wETH/wBTC/USDC-e, trading on PriveX & Carbon DeFi, referrals, social and community stuff

1nxcjsh,Comparing the Best/Worst Prediction Markets in crypto: Kalshi vs Polymarket vs SX Bet,"Tldr: So you have the attention span of an ape. Let me keep this short, then. Each prediction market is best/worst depending on where you live and what you bet. Polymarket is a beast on news and politics, crypto native. SX Bet is the best prediction market for sports by far, crypto native. Kalshi has high fees and not crypto native, but a cool site if you are in a US state that can't bet. But if you are a crypto investor and can't figure out how to use Polymarket and SX Bet then please just give up on crypto.

# Sports:

**ü•á SX Bet -**¬†Deepest Sports product by far, all the offerings, no fees, parlays, and best odds

**ü•àPolymarket -**¬†has about 60% of the sports markets, all the main ones. Just bad coverage on smaller sports like Tennis, UFC, and smaller soccer leagues. No parlays, but great odds and no fees.

ü•â**Kalshi -**¬†High fees and limited markets. Sports prices are fairly widely available, so it's weird for an exchange to not compete for best odds.

# News:

**ü•á Polymarket -**¬†Hundreds of markets, good liquidity and a nice UI

**ü•àKalshi -**¬†Less markets than Polymarket but good liquidity. And banking access to US

ü•â**SX bet -**¬†Limited to no news prediction markets. So clear last place here

# Access:

**ü•á SX bet & Polymarket -**¬†Both fully crypto native, bet in USDC. Deposit from any chain, self custody your crypto and limited to no KYC when you sign up. A dream for crypto users.

**ü•àKalshi -**¬†US licensed but no crypto options. Deposit through the banking system, they hold you money. They say they are going to accept stable coins soon, but as a funding option, they still hold your coins. Not your coins, not your crypto. Be careful here. Also i think you can just VPN on the top 2

looks like an extremely clean breakout after a little downtrend and finding the floor. 

So pretty much a breakout like this states one thing. The chart is NOT dead. Take that as you will, but for me it's a sign to double down. Study what I'm about to say next.

Jeets sell for a 2x

Traders take initials at a 2x

Believers take a 2x as confirmation and DOUBLE DOWN.

You can actively see believers in the trading history putting in mutliple eth buys. I dont know how this doesnt make you bullish. Because it fucking makes me pretty damn bullish and it should do the same to you.

And if you dont care about charts that okay, take your time to study Kendu and ensure you're fully positioned before it's too late.

I wonder if¬†$vfy, zK-Verify¬†could follow a similar path, considering it is built as a Layer-1 just for ZK proof verification that aims to cut costs by up to 90% and runs sub-second checks across Groth16, Plonky2, RISC0, and more. Does use case really matter in this era of hype and strong influential backing?

With so many top exchanges, including Binance and Bitget, already listing with Poolx on the latter, this shows the project term strong influence in the industry. Let's see how this played out, but i feel this is a long-term project. What do you think?

1nwb49d,$VOOZ: Big group chat features coming on VOOZ!,"Update on VOOZ:

We are currently building the location and gender filters on the VOOZ platform. Once done, an unmoderated clone of Vooz will be created. It will have the same design and tokenomics of the current Vooz platform, but without any moderation.

Once these are done, we will be building some pretty useful group chat features. There will be a new ‚Äúgroups‚Äù tab on the site. Users can start audio chats (similar to X spaces) and video chats with or without screenshare. They will have the options to have the groups have users with audio or just text in the main chatroom. These will be like small user defined groups for hangout or streaming. Users will be able to gift in those groups and do other fun things. Maybe we will connect it to anonymous chatting where the presenter can go in to anonymously chat and have others watch on Vooz.

Once these are done, there‚Äôs a big surprise and super innovative feature coming. Stay tuned‚Ä¶

1nv6jj7,Kendu - Inevitable Success,"[Ruben chugging a Kendu Energy!](https://reddit.com/link/1nv6jj7/video/nhg03ip2shsf1/player)

In crypto things seem quite random, coins pop off for seemingly no reason and 50x in a week, holders are left way richer whilst people on the sidelines wonder what happened. Yes sometimes it is simply something went viral on TikTok or something else but a lot of the time it's because people have been working in the background for months prior. The quick pumping coins don't last and fall flat soon after their pump but the ones backed by communities, they are here to stay and continue to grow.¬†

Coins that have solid communities always win, it is literally the recipe for success. Yes 99% of memecoins die early but it's because they have 0 community output so cannot attract new holders. Think Shib, Doge, Pepe they all had insanely strong communities, even Murad agrees.

**Community is everything**

Shoutout to¬†[u/Sensitive\_Hall\_4686](/user/Sensitive_Hall_4686/)¬†or BJ in the tg for this

If you listen to murads token 2049 speech he lays out the traits of successful alt/meme tokens and kendu checks all the boxes. I‚Äôll go through the list so you don‚Äôt have to bet recommend anyone taking the time to read this watch Murad's speech.¬†

1. Diamondhandedness- Holders never sell, period. Over 80% of our holder have held for 3 months and it‚Äôs almost the same amount for 6 months
2. High Community Price Targets- The more ambitious the internal community price target, the higher I‚Äôll go. Kendu is focused on deca billions and then ultimately being 100billion. This will happen based on the businesses alone
3. Holders Adding More- Holders \*add more"" on dips. Join the telegram and you‚Äôll watch diamond hand large bag holders add more and onboard daily
4. Belief- Holders genuinely believe and work towards multi Billion / deca Billion upside. We are going to 100billion
5. Free Cult Labor-Holders hustle harder than any paid employee or KOL, on all fronts. We have many very talented people who use their skills for kendu and or start businesses to include video game developers and graphic designers. None are paid and only benefit from making the project better.
6. Identity-Holders make the Memecoin their whole identity. This is an easy one, you‚Äôll see it in the telegram.
7. Critical Mass- Don't get left behind by betting on low cap coins that may or may not run. Focus on established coins that have critical mass. We are so widely distributed and no one sells, when this one rips it‚Äôs going to the moon
8. Recruiting-Holders onboard new people every day, non-stop. Both CT natives & outsider. Most of our recruits are outside of CT and from organic efforts
9. Socials-Holders dominate the Twitter timeline & replies ever day, non-stop. Easy one to check, search $KENDU on X
10. Culture and Lore- Unique Lingo. Unique Rituals. Unique Traditions. Unique Media. This is everywhere from the website to the telegram to X
11. Fun-Even during down moves holders are having a lot of fun. Never had more fun than chatting with the chads and chadettes from the telegram. We‚Äôve all made friends and we all genuinely care for the project and each others success.

Kendu literally checks all the points, it will be no surprise when Kendu pops off. Industry leaders all describe Kendu when naming desirable traits of a memecoin, with this community we are unstoppable

1nvcjas,Addressing some questions,"So Milkers, I‚Äôm part of the RAWW team. We‚Äôve been getting some common questions, and I want to address them here as well.

**Why isn‚Äôt RAWW pumping?**  
We hear this often. The truth is we can‚Äôt control when people buy, but we can keep building until RAWW is impossible to ignore. Instead of wasting milk on fake hype, we‚Äôre focused on lasting growth:  
  
‚Ä¢ Webtoons to reach a wider audience  
‚Ä¢ Our clicker game expanding to Steam  
‚Ä¢ [Pump.fun](http://Pump.fun) livestreams with the RAWW Milk Man  
‚Ä¢ Skits, comics, and nonstop memes  
  
RAWW isn‚Äôt about quick pumps. It‚Äôs about building something real. When the herd catches on, the upside will be insane. ü•õ  


**Why do the top holders own so much?**  
This is a fair concern. The top holder is Raydium with around 13 percent. Only one team wallet is in the top ten, ranked ninth, holding about 2.5 percent. The rest are whales who bought directly on the open market ( some near the ath), all verifiable on chain.   
  
In total, the top ten control closer to 35 percent, not 50. There is no instant fix since we cannot force buying or selling. As RAWW grows, whales will likely sell in smaller chunks, naturally improving distribution. The fact they have held for months shows real trust in RAWW.

**What‚Äôs next for RAWW?**

Immediate next steps include launching real life videos of the RAWW Milk Man sharing the RAWW lifestyle, releasing webtoons, and building new partnerships.

1nun90a,How I got interested in Falcon ($FAL) and why I‚Äôm watching it closely,"A buddy asked me the other day:¬†Yo, have you checked Falcon yet?

At first I hadn‚Äôt, but once I did some digging, I realized it‚Äôs not just another Layer 1.

Here‚Äôs what stood out for me:  
Falcon is an EVM-compatible Layer 1, so it works with the tools/devs already know.  
It claims 1,000+ TPS with sub-second finality, so performance is not just hype.  
What really caught my eye: gasless USDT transfers using protocol-level¬†*paymaster contracts*. The Falcon Foundation actually pre-funds these, so users don‚Äôt pay gas when moving stablecoins. That‚Äôs huge for reducing friction in everyday transactions.

On the market side:  
Some exchanges, including Bitget, offered pre-market futures for $FAL, giving early participants a way to gauge price before the spot listing.  
There‚Äôs also a launchpool campaign running, which is one of the ways projects often build initial engagement.

Whether Falcon can deliver on its stablecoin-focused pitch is still to be seen, but the concept is interesting enough that I‚Äôll be following how it develops.

1nud8a7,Falcon Finance ($FF) Listing ‚Äì Some thoughts after digging in,"CMC Link: [https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/falcon-finance-ff/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/falcon-finance-ff/)

Been reading a lot here lately about stablecoin projects sneaking into the alt scene, and it made me curious to check out Falcon Finance ($FF). Numbers caught my eye first: apparently over $1.8B USDf circulating supply, close to $1.9B TVL, and growing through collateralized debt positions (sort of a CDP play like MakerDAO but with its own twist). That‚Äôs not pocket change.

With stablecoin issuance booming again this year (USDT up $18B, USDC up $7B), projects like this might be in the right place at the right time. Daily DeFi transactions climbing toward $30B kind of confirm the momentum.

Personally, I first stumbled into $FF because of the listing on Bitget I had tried their launchpools before ($0G actually gave me some crazy good returns for just a few days of staking BGB). So when I saw $FF being added, I figured I‚Äôd keep an eye on it rather than sleep on another stablecoin/CDP project.

Not saying it‚Äôs the ‚Äúnext big thing,‚Äù but the combo of high TVL, decent track record on issuance, and a CEX listing to provide liquidity definitely makes it one to watch.

1nuc2an,My Experience with Crypto Launchpools,"When I first entered the world of crypto, one of my main goals was to find reliable ways of earning passive income. Like many others, I gravitated toward DeFi farming. The concept sounded ideal: stake tokens, provide liquidity, and watch the rewards come in. But after two years of farming across different platforms, the reality was far less rewarding than I had imagined. Yields were inconsistent, returns were often small, and the risks tied to smart contracts and market volatility made it difficult to feel secure.  
  
That experience pushed me to start looking for alternatives. Eventually, I came across exchange launchpools and began experimenting with a few platforms. Bitget quickly became one of the exchanges I used most often, mainly because the process was simple, the staking periods were short, and the rewards were easy to track.  
  
One of my recent experiences was with a project called $0G on Bitget, where I earned over $500 in just three days. It wasn‚Äôt the highest return I‚Äôve ever made in crypto, but it was one of the most stress-free. I‚Äôm now exploring other pools, like $FF, and the results continue to add up. Compared to my early DeFi farming days, this approach feels much more stable and predictable.

1nts9pm,Is the Universal Collateral Approach a Good Approach in DeFi?,"I've spent a fair bit of time in DeFi, experimenting with various collateralized lending and stablecoin protocols to see what holds up during market swings, and the universal collateral model in projects like Falcon Finance has me thinking it's a solid evolution if executed right. By allowing users to convert any liquid asset digital cryptos, fiat-backed tokens or tokenized RWAs into USD pegged liquidity through minting USDf, an overcollateralized synthetic stable, it broadens accessibility beyond the usual ETH or BTC dominance. The active management of that collateral via strategies such as basis spreads, funding rate arbitrage on both sides, cross-exchange arb, and native staking adds a layer of yield optimization that feels more proactive than what I've seen in simpler vaults on platforms like MakerDAO, potentially reducing liquidation risks while keeping things efficient.

That said, the sUSDf extension, where you stake USDf for a yield bearing version with institutional-grade strategies and APY boosts for fixed-term locks, appeals to my preference for set-it-and-forget-it farming without constant monitoring. The $FF token underpins governance, rewards and exclusive access, which could foster better alignment if the community stays engaged. I caught wind that it got listed on Binance yesterday after a short delay and it's also on Bitget with a launchpool where you can lock BGB or FF to farm tokens until tomorrow. Curious if folks here think this approach mitigates some of DeFi's fragmentation issues, or how it fares against competitors like Abracadabra or Reflexer?

1ntu5fv,"Catching Trends in Tokens, My Experience with $HEMI","One thing i have learned in this space is that trading trending tokens is a game of timing. When a token starts picking up momentum, you can almost feel the shift, more chatter, more volume, and suddenly it is on everyone‚Äôs radar. That is when i try to step in, but the tricky part is knowing when to exit before the hype dies down.

Recently, i managed to catch $HEMI while it was trending. It was not because i had some secret alpha, but just from paying attention to volume spikes and community buzz. The price action lined up with what i was looking for, and it ended up being one of those trades where entering at the right time really made a difference.

Of course, i have also been on the other side where i chased too late and ended up holding bags. That is why i try to remind myself not every trend is worth chasing, and risk management matters even when things look like they are mooning.

These days, i have been keeping an eye on different ways tokens are traded too. Another tool i use to stay flexible instead of relying only on one type of platform is Bitget onchain

At the end of the day, catching a trend feels great, but i think the real key is discipline, knowing when to get in, when to scale out, and being okay if you miss one. Because there is always another trend around the corner.

1ntknid,Bitlight Balances Speculation and Long-Term Adoption,"Bitlight‚Äôs price is currently shaped by a mix of ecosystem incentives, exchange events, and ongoing development. While speculative flows play a role, the bigger story lies in how adoption of Bitcoin Layer 2 solutions can translate into real usage for the token.

A major catalyst has been Bitlight‚Äôs airdrop program, with over 50% of supply allocated to ecosystem incentives for RGB holders and early adopters. These rewards mirror the playbook used by early DeFi projects to bootstrap activity.

Looking further ahead, Bitlight‚Äôs $9.6 million funding round is fueling RGB-Lightning integration, aiming to combine smart contracts with the Lightning Network for instant stablecoin payments.

Bitcoin is down 2% and ETH is down 10%, it is far more brutal for smaller caps though, but they'll bounce back.

Whilst I have already mentioned you will probs make money with anything you buy rn, but the thing is choosing randomly is not the way. **Buying random coin with a funny name that is making the rounds on social media is not the way, these coins do not last, instead choose coins backed by communities that have worked non stop for over a year.** This is why you should buy Kendu, we are not going anywhere at all, it is a high conviction investment and this is NFA but there is absolutely 0 buying at these levels and beyond. I am literally a uni student with about ¬£250 to my name and I put all spare money into Kendu knowing it is free money and the odds are way in my favour.

Kendu is building a real foundation not just with an amazing social media presence which tbh deserves a billion dollar market cap by itself, but also with an insane real life presence. This real life presence will spread into every single industry, spreading the Kendu brand globally ensuring that every single country has holds Kendu. 

Here is a list of these efforts:

* Kendu Coffee 
* Kendu Energy
* Kendu Merch
* Kendu Hotdog Stand in Florida
* Kendu animation¬†
* Kendu Board Game
* Kendu Creator
* Kendu Jewellery
* Kendu Beer
* Kendu Video Games

* Kendu Plushies
* Kendu Vendu - vending machines in Nashville Tennessee
* Kendu Press¬†
* Kendu Hand Cream
* Kendu Discs
* Kendu Sneakers
* Kendu Spice
* Kendu Radio Show

All of these are not done by a team, but by the average holder! 

Kendu is completely decentralised, 1000 minds are better than 10 and this is how we are revolutionising the space all whilst sitting at around 10 million market cap. Shib 1000x in 36 days and so can Kendu, 10 billion would actually be undervalued, no one has done anything on this scale with this ferocity ever

1nsr2wr,Bitcoin meme,"$DOG (Bitcoin meme coin) Has Upside Potential

Here are some reasons people are excited about $DOG, the meme coin built on the Bitcoin blockchain (Runes Protocol):

‚∏ª

1.	‚Å†Bitcoin Security & Brand

Since it lives on Bitcoin, $DOG benefits from the most secure and decentralized blockchain. That sets it apart from most other meme coins.

2. Fair Launch & Community First ‚Ä¢	No premine ‚Ä¢	No team allocation ‚Ä¢	100% airdropped to the community This gives $DOG strong grassroots support and avoids the classic ‚Äúdev dump‚Äù issue.

3. Fixed Supply (100B)

Everyone knows the total supply upfront. No hidden inflation, no surprises.

4. Growing Interest

Some institutions and public companies have already started accumulating, which helps with legitimacy and liquidity.

5. Tied to Bitcoin‚Äôs Momentum

When Bitcoin does well, $DOG can ride the wave since it‚Äôs Bitcoin-native. Strong BTC = more attention on $DOG.

6. Meme Power + Community Hype

Like all meme coins, community + virality matter. $DOG is already picking up speed as ‚Äúthe Dogecoin of Bitcoin.‚Äù

7. Accessible Speculation

It‚Äôs cheap enough for small investors to grab a bag and hope for outsized gains ‚Äî the same recipe that has fueled other meme runs.

8. Different From the Rest

Most meme coins live on Ethereum or Solana. $DOG is Bitcoin-native, which gives it a unique narrative in a crowded market.

‚∏ª

TL;DR: $DOG = Meme coin + Bitcoin security + Fair launch + Strong community + Fixed supply. Not financial advice, but the upside case is clear.

Most memecoins peak in days and die in weeks. RAWW has been alive for 9 months, and in that time, it‚Äôs transformed into something bigger than a meme.

In that time, the team has created:

* A playable ASMR clicker game already keeping the community engaged
* A merch line made from real natural fibers
* Skits, comics, and nonstop memes fueling organic growth
* Weekly [pump.fun](http://pump.fun) livestreams with the RAWW Milk Man
* A brand identity that feels more like culture than just a coin

All of this exists today, live, playable, wearable, and shareable. And yet, the market cap sits at only $120k.

This isn‚Äôt a ‚Äúpromise and roadmap‚Äù meme. It‚Äôs entertainment, utility, and brand power that‚Äôs already shipping.

The best part? RAWW still feels extremely undervalued. But once the herd finds it, the upside is insane. A base this strong makes tens of millions inevitable for RAWW.

1ns9ro3,Falcon Finance and the Growing Attention Around $FF,"Falcon Finance is positioning itself as a universal collateral infrastructure, enabling users to transform a wide range of liquid assets, whether digital tokens, currency backed assets, or tokenized RWAs, into USD pegged onchain liquidity. The core of the platform revolves around USDf, an overcollateralized synthetic stablecoin backed by diversified yield strategies such as basis spreads, funding rate arbitrage, cross exchange opportunities, and native staking.

Alongside it, the protocol also offers sUSDf, a yield bearing version of USDf designed for long term holders. It provides exposure to institutional grade strategies while rewarding participants with boosted APY tiers when they commit to fixed term locks. This structure aims to balance stability with consistent returns for users seeking more than just basic arbitrage gains.

The native token, $FF, anchors the ecosystem by granting access to governance, staking rewards, and community incentives, as well as unlocking exclusive platform features. With Bitget already giving the project notable attention, I think that visibility could translate into stronger market activity around $FF, as exchange support often plays a key role in liquidity depth and broader¬†adoption.

* On the SocialFi side, they‚Äôre testing out a system where you can earn $LMAO tokens for being active on platforms like X or Telegram. Basically: good posts = rewards.
* They also have a launchpad called **Dlu-Pools**, where holding $LMAO lets you support new crypto startups and get early backer rewards. Plus, every time a project launches, a portion of $LMAO gets burned, which makes the supply smaller over time.

The token is also **deflationary,** allocations keep shrinking with each new utility they roll out, which could make it more scarce in the long run.

At its core, it is still a meme coin, but one that is trying to give holders something extra beyond just the vibes. The real question is: will people like the mix of memes + utility, or do they just want their memes to stay memes?

Not only was it recorded (link below, it was brief at just over a half hour), but I'll share some of the meeting minutes to give you guys a quick idea!

October is going to be a big month, the dev team has been making excellent progress towards a Q4 release! More detailed information is expected to be released, as well as possibly another public beta of the SfW platform showcasing some of the improvements made over the past couple months. More information on the casino games will also become available, and how the games are designed to be provably fair with winning odds as high as they can reasonably be to self-fund the platform with other operating revenues. One of the main goals after all is to make sure the people can win as much as financially possible!

All in all, SRY and SfW is being designed to bring fun AND trust back into meme coins! Expect the team to do more x spaces and other social media events in the future as we get closer and closer to launch!!!

1nqnw43,How You Can Benefit From Kendu,"Dear reader, I am obviously a stranger, well most likely anyways lol, that would be some coincidenceüòÇKendu has a very welcoming and diverse community with members from around the world, I am personally from England. We have groups for different languages: Spanish, Arabic, French, German, Portuguese, Russian, Chinese, Japanese, Indonesian, Korean, Thai, Turkish, Zulu.

Under the Kendu umbrella you can release products, receive insanely strong social media engagement and sell your product to an already established user base. For example we have energy drinks, coffee, beer, clothes, shoes, video games, spices already and so much more! You can come and join the party too with whatever your interests are. You can also plan IRL events like we have a team in Florida called KenduSTREET who attend lots of festivals and spread the Kendu brand! Or in India we have had Pickleball competitions and also a running club! Whatever it is the KENDU Community will be very appreciative, whether you have been here 1 day or since day 1 this opportunity is open to everyone.¬†**You can explore your creative passions and desires with Kendu!**

https://preview.redd.it/kdsjijowqerf1.jpg?width=1703&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d82fd2d86d7041f6ebe2c71cf48b6c52cc96c5cd

Now I do understand if you are only here to make money because admittedly I was at the start but that has since changed. Anyways, at currently 10 million market cap Kendu is an absolute steal, the vast majority of memes are down this year and Kendu is no different, we have around a 28x to ATH, this is literally free money. If you put in $1000, chances are you're gonna make at least $28k this AltSeason whenever it hits.¬†**This is obviously NFA,**¬†but I am certainly investing my money.

The crypto game is a lot about community, community effort is everything and Kendu has this in bags. Check any crypto subreddit, we will dominate it, check any X post we will be there, check on Stocktwits we are a leader etc. This is no accident, if we look at the past all the strongest communities have come out on top from Shib to Doge to Pepe to whatever else you want, historically the strongest communities are the most likely to perform the best in terms of price action. This time its not gonna be any different...

Kendu is only the 2nd coin to ever reach 50k Certik votes(it is a very sought after audit), the only other coin to manage this was Pepe. Pepe reached 10 billion market cap outside of a bull run... this just shows the potential that Kendu has. If Pepe can reach 10 billion Kendu can soar past this.

Murad and other prominent crypto people preach community, community, community.

So why not buy Kendu?

Literal life changing money is on the table and tbh it is the most educated investment you can make rn, coins over 500 million have kinda had most of their pump. Kendu still has a 28x before we reach there current market cap...

We have groups for different languages: Spanish, Arabic, French, German, Portuguese, Russian, Chinese, Japanese, Indonesian, Korean, Thai, Turkish, Zulu.

Under the Kendu umbrella you can release products, receive insanely strong social media engagement and sell your product to an already established user base. For example we have energy drinks, coffee, beer, clothes, shoes, video games, spices already and so much more! You can come and join the party too with whatever your interests are. You can also plan IRL events like we have a team in Florida called KenduSTREET who attend lots of festivals and spread the Kendu brand! Or in India we have had Pickleball competitions and also a running club! Whatever it is the KENDU Community will be very appreciative, whether you have been here 1 day or since day 1 this opportunity is open to everyone.¬†**You can explore your creative passions and desires with Kendu!**

Now I do understand if you are only here to make money because admittedly I was at the start but that has since changed. Anyways, at currently 10 million market cap Kendu is an absolute steal, the vast majority of memes are down this year and Kendu is no different, we have around a 28x to ATH, this is literally free money. If you put in $1000, chances are you're gonna make at least $28k this AltSeason whenever it hits.¬†**This is obviously NFA,**¬†but I am certainly investing my money.

The crypto game is a lot about community, community effort is everything and Kendu has this in bags. Check any crypto subreddit, we will dominate it, check any X post we will be there, check on Stocktwits we are a leader etc. This is no accident, if we look at the past all the strongest communities have come out on top from Shib to Doge to Pepe to whatever else you want, historically the strongest communities are the most likely to perform the best in terms of price action. This time its not gonna be any different...

Kendu is only the 2nd coin to ever reach 50k Certik votes(it is a very sought after audit), the only other coin to manage this was Pepe. Pepe reached 10 billion market cap outside of a bull run... this just shows the potential that Kendu has. If Pepe can reach 10 billion Kendu can soar past this.

Murad and other prominent crypto people preach community, community, community.

So why not buy Kendu?

Literal life changing money is on the table and tbh it is the most educated investment you can make rn, coins over 500 million have kinda had most of their pump. Kendu still has a 28x before we reach there current market cap...

1nrcvac,How $BGB and Bitget Launchpools Are Saving My Crypto Portfolio in This Market Downturn.,"I've been knee-deep in the crypto trenches for years now, riding the waves of volatility like most of us here. But let me tell you, the last 7 days have been a bloodbath for my portfolio literally 99.9% of my holdings tanked over 20% each, leaving me staring at a sea of red that could make even the most seasoned HODLer sweat. The one saving grace? $BGB. This token has been my portfolio's lifeline, stubbornly holding onto green territory while everything else crumbled. It's a reminder of why I diversified into utility tokens like BGB in the first place they're built for stability in ecosystems like Bitget, and right now, it's the only thing keeping my overall balance from total annihilation.

That said, I'm not just sitting back and hoping for a miracle; I've been actively farming launchpools to claw back some gains, and the timing couldn't be better. The $0G launchpool came through clutch, pumping out solid returns that softened the blow from my other positions and gave me some much-needed breathing room. Now, with $XPL kicking off again, I'm going all in on this one staking everything I've got into it. The reward pool is a hefty 2,200,000 XPL, and based on the last run where the listing price surged 60% and APY hit an impressive 67%, I'm optimistic this could be another winner. If you're in a similar spot, definitely check it out; these opportunities have been my secret weapon for staying afloat in this brutal market. What's been saving your portfolios lately?

1nr35j5,$XPL Breakout and What Comes Next,"Yesterday $XPL just broke out with a sharp +24% move, lifting from its consolidation base under $0.90 into the $1+ zone with strong backing from both volume and open interest. It was the kind of breakout that shows real strength after weeks of accumulation, and now the main question is whether that momentum can hold.

The range around $0.95‚Äì1.00 is where the real test sits. If buyers can defend it and flip it into support, that zone becomes the launchpad for another leg higher. A retest of $1.50 isn‚Äôt far-fetched if momentum continues to build, and the structure suggests that the move isn‚Äôt just a one-off spike but a trend trying to form.

While I‚Äôm watching price action closely, I‚Äôm also considering other ways to stay positioned. Using Bitget Launchpool to earn extra XPL on the side while waiting for the next price hike feels like a way to keep exposure working for me without forcing trades.

1nqx3dn,Why Klink‚Äôs Earn Model Stands Out for Users and Advertisers in Web3,"https://preview.redd.it/67gzepz6dhrf1.jpg?width=680&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6eeb2a7a66f840ac59b286e68cf63a09ae567bbb

I came across Klink Finance recently and what stood out is how it tries to balance things for both users and projects. Most platforms lean too much toward hype or a single feature. With Klink, the whole point is that you can earn through multiple paths. You can try apps, complete tasks, take part in campaigns, and even stake tokens if that is your preference.

The $KLINK token makes this possible. It is used as the exchange point within the ecosystem, which gives it a real purpose instead of being only a governance coin like so many others. I think this balance is why Klink already has a solid user base of more than 850k people. Add the fact that over 500 advertisers are on board and it seems like they are building a sustainable loop between users and projects.

The upcoming TGE on October 7 is going to be an important moment. If Klink delivers on the momentum it has built so far, the project might carve out a space of its own in the earn sector of crypto. Personally, I like projects that focus on utility first because that is what lasts over time.

1npfj8s,ChainOpera AI Prepares for Bitget Listing,"Artificial intelligence continues to expand across industries, and projects focused on AI agents are becoming more visible. ChainOpera AI (COAI) is preparing for its listing on Bitget. The project is led by a founder with prior experience and has support from venture firms and partnerships. Its timing coincides with Bitget‚Äôs shift toward a universal exchange model, which could provide a relevant setting for COAI‚Äôs approach to building, training, deploying, and monetizing AI agents on-chain.

From my perspective, the setup looks worth following. I‚Äôve seen how past AI-related listings, like $0G, attracted attention when they first launched, and COAI seems to be entering under somewhat similar conditions. That doesn‚Äôt mean the outcome will be the same, but it makes me curious to see whether this listing can generate comparable momentum once it goes live.

1nngrkc,Lets Talk About Distribution,"Distribution is arguably one of the most important factors when predicting which coin will be the next to truly pop off. These crazy week long pumps happen due to many factors such as **people FOMOing, reduced sell pressure** and a few others that tbh aren't as important as the other 2.

**So What Would Make a Coin Have Reduced Sell Pressure?**

Well sell pressure is just due to holders becoming disinterested or losing faith in a project but tbh in many cases it is due to impatience and wanting to chase the next big thing and this causes them to get wrecked often. There are countless posts on Reddit about how people sold Shib before the pump, unfortunately redistribution can be and is often a brutal period and many coins die but the ones that don't usually thrive after. If you look at the big memes you will see examples of this redistribution where the chart is just flat or even going down for months on end.

However this is just tokens swapping hands to people who will not sell and guess what happens when people don't sell...sell pressure becomes non existent.

**So What Would Cause People To Fomo?**

Green attracts green, people run at the first sign of green trying to catch the next best thing, obviously those who were holding before the pump make far more as many miss the majority of the pump but still FOMO is mainly due to things running, which is again linked to sell pressure.

**The Below Figure Shows Which Coins Have the Most Diamond Handed Holders**

Look at Kendu, it stands out amongst the rest by far having the most percentages held for the longer period of times. This clearly shows a quite large price recalibration will be happening soon, sell pressure is gonna be nonexistent and FOMO will come fast. Kendu is unstoppable on many metrics and here is another one. 

IMO the next coin to pump to crazy levels will be Kendu and as discussed you wanna be here before this happens to get the max gains.
